Introduction: 



Savage Worlds 
In barbaric worlds of fantasy and far-flung galaxies, great 
heroes battle for gold, glory, justice, or mere survival. Some 
wear mithril armor and wield massive swords glowing with 
magical energy. Others are commandos in the latest ballistic 
vests spraying lead from their submachine guns. Some aren’t 
even human. 

But they are all heroes, and their epic tales inspire those 
who read them. This game system attempts to simulate 
these incredible tales—at least in our imaginations—giving 
form, structure, and challenge to the heroes and the savage 
worlds they walk in with rules that are simple on the surface 
and comprehensive in their depth. 

The game focuses on the action rather than statistics and 
bookkeeping, allowing the Game Master to concentrate on 
the player characters, their foes, and the fantastic settings 
they battle in. 

For players, Savage Worlds has an extremely rich 
advancement system that lets you create everything from a 
swashbuckling rogue to a charismatic investigative reporter. 

Some “generic” rules systems come up lacking in certain 
settings. Savage Worlds avoids this with Setting Rules (you’ll 
find a list of common Setting Rules on page 94). These allow 
the Game Master to fundamentally alter the feel of the game 
without changing the basic mechanics. Players can explore 
haunted space hulks in power armor, battle dragons, or surf 
the matrix of a virtual computer world without having to learn 
all-new rules. But throw in something like Righteous Rage 
from Solomon Kane®—which makes a hero far more deadly 
in his most desperate moments—and the entire feel of the 
game changes in an instant. 

What’s New? 

This deluxe version of the Savage Worlds rules system is the 
culmination of a decade’s play with suggestions and comments 
gathered from our own campaigns and the thousands of 
adventures we’ve run at game stores and conventions across 
the globe. For those who have already played we think you’ll 
find this the most complete and comprehensive edition of the 
rules we’ve ever published. We’ve compiled the best material 
from our setting books and added in web updates like gritty 
damage rules and interludes. Races and vehicles are back 
from the first edition, as well as the race creation rules from 
the Fantasy Companion and a consolidated list of all the best 
powers from our many expansions. 

Veterans of our game will also find a number of Design 
Notes scattered throughout the book. These are insights into 
why a particular rule is written the way it is and the thinking 
that went into it. 

For those who are new, we welcome you to the “Savages,” 
and encourage you to join one of the most friendly, helpful, 
and enthusiastic communities in gaming on our forums and 
mailing lists. 

And if you already own Savage Worlds and want a list of all 
the changes or additions we’ve made here completely free, 
just go to our website at www.peginc.com! 

Now let your imagination wander to worlds of danger and 
adventure, where heroes are larger than life and monsters 
stalk the land. These are savage worlds—and those who 
survive them become legends...

Getting Started 


You’ll need a few other items besides this book to begin 
your journey: 

Dice 

Savage Worlds uses traditional gaming dice: 4-sided, 
6-sided, 8-sided, 10-sided, 12-sided, and some settings use 
a 20-sided die as well. As a player, you’ll also want a “Wild 
Die,” a d6 of a different color which we’ll explain in Chapter 
One. Dice are available from your favorite local gaming store, 
or online directly from Pinnacle. 

We abbreviate the different dice as d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and 
d20. If you see something like 2d6+1, that means to roll two 
six-sided dice, add the two together, then add 1 to the total. 

Players need only one set of dice. The Game Master might 
want a couple of sets so she can roll attacks for several 
villains at once. 

The Action Deck 

Savage Worlds uses a standard deck of playing cards with 
the Jokers left in. Cards are used for initiative in combat and 
to help keep things moving fast and furious. You’ll even find an 
official set of Savage Worlds cards where you found this book! 

A Setting

Will you and your friends explore post-apocalyptic ruins? 
Lead a rugged warband in your favorite fantasy world? Take 
on the role of vampire lords? Or perhaps fight evil in the many 
theaters of Weird Wars? 

Pick up the book for your favorite game setting at your local 
game store, or create your own. Official Savage Settings 
include new Edges and Hindrances, Setting Rules, spells, 
weapons, gear, monsters, and more! 

We talk more about some of our settings on pages 7 through 
15. 

The Adventure Deck 

We also make an exciting Adventure Deck that adds an 
additional aspect of player control to the game. Your hero 
might find a new romance, make a lifelong enemy, or do 
additional damage in that critical fight. Look for it on our 
website or in better game and hobby stores. 

Using Miniatures

The rules are written for the table-top because that requires 
exact measurements and precise rules. That’s why all the 
weapon ranges and movement values are listed in inches 
(rather than yards or some other unit). Using miniatures and 
terrain or a battle-mat can really help your players understand 
the tactical situation and better interact with their environment, 
and we highly recommend this style of play for most games. 

But miniatures certainly aren’t required, and you’ll find rules 
for “guesstimating” ranges, how many foes are caught in a 
blast radius, and other issues on page 65. 

If you do decide to use miniatures, check the Pinnacle 
website for metal miniatures for our games as well as 
cardboard and cardstock variants. 


5 

Savage Settings 
Pinnacle has created many Savage Settings, from our 
award-winning Deadlands and its spin-offs Hell on Earth and 
Lost Colony to Rippers and Necessary Evil and Weird Wars. 
We’ve also licensed some of our favorite worlds, such as 
Frank Chadwick’s Space 1889® and The Savage World of 
Solomon Kane®. A few of our settings, such as Andy Hopp’s 
brilliant Low Life, are published by Pinnacle but owned by 
their creators. 

You’ll find a sneak peek at a few of these settings on the 
following pages. 

Plot Point Campaigns 

Like our rules system, our settings are designed to be easy 
for the Game Master to run. That’s why many of our Savage 
Settings feature “Plot Point Campaigns,” a backstory to the 
campaign world and a set of adventures that resolve the main 
plot. Interspersed between these Plot Points are Savage 
Tales—short adventures that can be run depending on where 
the party goes and what they do. Of course a Game Master can 
also insert his own adventures into the campaign, including 
those based around the player characters’ backstories. 

The idea is to communicate a big backstory—like the 
flooding of the world in 50 Fathoms—but still give Game 
Masters the freedom to construct and run their own stories 
in the foreground. In this game, the heroes are a crew of 
explorers, traders, or even pirates sailing about a drowning 
world. They can seek out whatever destiny they choose, but 
will become entangled in the fight against the Sea Hags—the 
creatures destroying Caribdus—as well. 

Savage Tales

The adventures in our books are called “Savage Tales,” short 
and direct adventure outlines the Game Master can run with 
only a few minutes of preparation. We do this by cutting to 
the most important details of an encounter. 


Ideally, a Game Master can find out what his group is 
interested in doing that session, read no more than a page 
or so, and be ready to run the game. He can always put more 
into it if he wishes, but all the crucial ingredients for running 
a fun game are there in detail. 

Savagery 

If you decide you like Savage Worlds, you might want to 
check out some of our settings and other resources. Some 
basic information is found below, and you can find more detail, 
free downloads, and support materials at our website: www. 
peginc.com. 

Settings

From space opera to Western to Puritan adventures, we 
make a lot of exciting settings. Our philosophy has always 
been to do things a little differently than everyone else. Most of 
our worlds have a unique twist we think makes them special. 
For example, Evernight begins in a typical fantasy world of 
elves and dwarves—but quickly changes as strange spikes 
drop from the heavens and spill forth something terrible from 
beyond the stars. 

Some of our largest game lines, such as Deadlands, are 
open settings with multiple Plot Point Campaigns presented 
separately. For example, The Flood revolves around fighting 
Reverend Ezekiah Grimme in what’s left of California after the 
Great Quake—the Maze. Stone and a Hard Place is all about 
the game’s deadliest gunslinger and killer of heroes: Stone. 
Stand-alone adventures such as Coffin Rock, or add-ons like 
the Smith & Robards Catalog, featuring dozens of steampunk 
inventions, are also available. 

Companions

Our Companions focus on new Edges and Hindrances, 
powers, monsters, and Setting Rules for particular genres 
such as Fantasy, Horror, Science Fiction, and more. 

Adventures 

Full-length adventures are available for most of our settings, 
as well as unique tales set in worlds of their own, such as 
Zombie Run, a survivor adventure set in America after a 
worldwide outbreak of undead. 

Accessories 

We’ve already mentioned our official Action & Adventure 
Decks. We also manufacture custom Bennies for each of 
our lines—custom poker chips with images specific to the 
setting. Licensees also make plastic templates, dice, and 
other specialty items. Check our webstore at www.peginc. 
com for the latest. 

Forums 

We’re very proud of our forums, and think we have the best 
community in all of gaming. If you have a question, visit the 
forums and the other Savages, or our own writers, will happily 
answer it for you. You can also find new world, campaign, or 
adventure ideas, groups to play with, and Game Mastering 
advice, all from a friendly and welcoming community that 
loves to game.

Space 1889: Red Sands 
Mars needs heroes! 

Frank Chadwick’s classic Space 1889® gets savage in this 
intergalactic Plot Point Campaign! 

While the Empires of Earth battle over Mars’ red plains and crimson hills, a 
villain known as Kronos seizes the technology of a long-dead race to threaten 
to repel the “alien” invaders forever. 



Deadlands: The Weird West 

The year is 1876, but the history is not our own. 

A vengeful shaman named Raven opened the doorway to Hell and released the manitous—demonic 
creatures that flooded the world with magic and monsters. Some heroes have learned to harness this 
arcane power to fight the growing evil. Others rely on their blazing six-guns or weird science. 

And some are too tough to die and come back from the grave wrestling a manitou for incredible 
powers—and their very souls. 


Weird Wars: Weird War Two 

In the violence and horror of war, dark things rise. 

Monsters have always lurked in the shadows, feeding on the fear and terror of war. The occultists and 
scientists of the Third Reich have realized this, secretly researching forbidden lore, gathering ancient relics, 
and recruiting or creating inhuman monsters to subjugate the world. 

Never before has such a conflict spread to so many corners of 

the globe or given rise to so many horrors. Time is running out. 
The Allies have gathered a secret organization of soldiers, sailors, 
and survivors to battle the monsters of the Third Reich and the 
creatures rising in the growing darkness. 



The Savage World of Solomon Kane® 
A landless man. A Wanderer. A Puritan. 

He stalks the land, a wanderer of fate. He is Solomon Kane®, puritan, adventurer, hero. 

Kane punishes the wicked. Hundreds have fallen before his saber and pistols. 

But rarely, Kane finds one who wants to atone—a tainted soul who realizes the evil he’s done in his life. These 

hopeful few are tasked to wander the earth as Kane does, searching out the horrors of the world to battle and defeat 

them. Most will perish in this arduous quest. Others will find redemption. A few will become heroes. 

All will walk the Path of Kane. 



Rippers 

Stalk the creatures of the night—or become one! 

Rippers are a secret cabal of scholars, warriors, sages, and heroes who battle legendary horrors 
around the globe. But willpower, science, technology, and steel are not their only weapons. Abraham 
Van Helsing and “Dr. Jack” have shown the Rippers how to extract the essences or natural tools 
of the creatures they battle—and implant it in themselves. 

Those who survive the process may become fearsome warriors, fighting 

with the claws of a werewolf or the teeth of a piranha-man. Others go mad 

from the procedure and become that which they once hunted. 

And at least one has become the greatest traitor the Rippers have ever 

known… 



Chapter One: 
Character Creation 
Great heroes are more than a collection of statistics and 
numbers, but in a game system this is certainly where they 
begin. To make your hero, download a Savage Worlds 
character sheet from our website (www.peginc.com) or copy 
the one found at the back of this book and follow the steps 
below. 

1. Race 
Humans are the most common characters, but some settings 
may feature bizarre aliens, graceful elves, or other exotic 
races—some examples of which you’ll find on page 20. You 
can choose to play any race available in your particular setting. 

• 
Humans are the standard race in Savage Worlds, and 
start play with one free Edge (see Step 3). 
2. Traits 
Characters are defined by attributes and skills, collectively 
called “Traits,” and both work in exactly the same way. 
Attributes and skills are ranked by die types, from a d4 to a 
d12, with d6 being the average for adult humans. Higher is 
better! 

Attributes 

Every character starts with a d4 in each attribute, and has 
5 points with which to raise them. Raising a d4 to a d6, for 
example, costs 1 point. You’re free to spend these points 
however you want with one exception: no attribute may be 
raised above a d12. 

• 
Agility is your hero’s nimbleness, quickness, and 
dexterity. 
• 
Smarts is a measure of how well your character knows 
his world and culture, how well he thinks on his feet, and 
mental agility. 

• 
Spirit reflects inner wisdom and willpower. Spirit is very 
important as it helps your character recover from being 
Shaken (see page 68). 
• 
Strength is raw physical power and general fitness. 
Strength is also used to generate your warrior’s damage 
in hand-to-hand combat. 
• 
Vigor represents endurance, resistance to disease, 
poison, or toxins, and how much pain and physical 
damage a hero can shake off. 
Skills 

Skills are learned abilities such as Shooting, Fighting, 
scientific knowledge, professional aptitudes, and so on. These 
are very general descriptions which cover all related aspects. 
Shooting, for example, covers all types of guns, bows, rocket 
launchers, and other ranged weapons. 

You have 15 skill points to distribute among your skills. Each 
die type costs 1 point (starting at d4) as long as the skill is 
equal to or less than the attribute it’s linked to (listed beside 
the skill in parentheses). If you exceed the attribute, the cost 
becomes 2 points per die type. 

As with attributes, no skill may be increased above d12. 

Example: Fighting is linked to Agility. A character 

with a d8 Agility can buy Fighting for one point per die 

type to d8. Buying a d10 costs 2 points, and a d12 

costs another 2 points. 

Derived Statistics 

Your character sheet contains a few other statistics you need 
to fill in, described below. 

16 

5. Background Details
Charisma is a measure of your character’s appearance, 
manner, and general likability. It’s 0 unless you have Edges 
or Hindrances that modify it. Charisma is added to Persuasion 
and Streetwise rolls, and is used by the GM to figure out how 
nonplayer characters react to your hero. 

Pace is how fast your character moves in a standard combat 
round. Humans walk 6” in a round and can move an additional 
1d6” if they run. Write “6” on your character sheet beside 
the word Pace. This is 6” on the table-top—every inch there 
represents 2 yards in the “real world.” 

Parry is equal to 2 plus half your character’s Fighting (2 if 
a character does not have Fighting), plus any bonuses for 
shields or certain weapons. This is the Target Number (TN) 
to hit your hero in hand-to-hand combat. 

For stats such as d12+1, add half the fixed modifier, rounded 
down. For instance, a Fighting skill of d12+1 grants a Parry of 
8 (2+half of d12), whereas a d12+2 gives a Parry of 9 (2+half 
of d12+2). 

Toughness is your hero’s damage threshold. Anything over 
this causes him to be rattled or worse. Toughness is 2 plus 
half your hero’s Vigor, plus Armor (use the armor worn on his 
torso). Vigor over a d12 is calculated just like Parry. 

3. Edges & Hindrances 
Great heroes are far more than a collection of skills and 
attributes. It’s their unique gifts, special powers, and tragic 
flaws that truly make them interesting characters. 

Characters can take Edges by balancing them out 
with Hindrances. You’ll find a complete list of Edges and 
Hindrances later in this chapter. Look for more in our Savage 
Settings. 

You can take one Major Hindrance and two Minor 
Hindrances. A Major Hindrance is worth 2 points, and a Minor 
Hindrance is worth 1 point. 

For 2 points you can: 

• 
Raise an attribute one die type, or 
• 
Choose an Edge 
For 1 point you can: 

• 
Gain another skill point, or 
• 
Gain additional money equal to your starting funds (if you 
start with $500, you gain an additional $500) 
4. Gear 
Next you need to purchase equipment. Some settings may 
provide your hero with all the gear he needs. In others, you 
may be assigned a certain amount of money with which to 
purchase your starting gear. A list of some common gear and 
weapons can be found in Chapter Two. 

Unless your setting book or GM says otherwise, the standard 
starting amount is $500. 

Finish your character by filling in any history or background 
you care to. Ask yourself why your hero is where she is and 
what her goals are. Or you can just start playing and fill in 
these details as they become important. 

You might also want to talk to the other players. Maybe your 
characters know each other right from the start. Or you might 
collectively decide to optimize your group a bit and ensure 
you’ve got a good assortment of skills and abilities. If so, make 
sure you’re playing what you want to play. There’s no point 
in being the party’s magical healer, for example, if that’s not 
a role you’re interested in. 

Design Note - Roleplaying 

Most of us tend to play a particular character type 

and stick with it regardless of genre or game system. 
There’s certainly nothing wrong with that, and you 
should absolutely play what you enjoy most of the time. 

It’s also great to occasionally break out of your usual 

mold and try something different. Challenge yourself 
to play a different character type now and then. Maybe 
you always play big tough guys and like being the 
“brick” of the party. Next time your friend runs a swords 
& sorcery game, try being the mage. You may find you 

love being a spellcaster. 

Game Masters are also encouraged to try new things 
now and then. Some of the most incredible sessions 
we’ve played in have featured very strange character 

types, such as kobold slaves, the elderly, and even 
intelligent animals. And nothing beats the bizarre and 

amazing world of Andy Hopp’s Low Life. 

We encourage you to try something new once in 
a while. You can always slip 

right back into that very 
comfortable and familiar 


role you already know 
you enjoy next time out.

Archetypes 
Sometimes you may want to quickly create a character for 
a one-shot or convention adventure. For those occasions, an 
Archetype might be a good choice. Add a name, Hindrances,

to play!

Making characters in Savage Worlds is easy, but it 
still takes a while for everyone to figure out what they 
want, make it, and look through the rulebook and the 
particular setting book to get it done. 

These Archetypes let you jump right in with little 
effort. They’re also a great tool to use with younger 
or more inexperienced roleplayers who may be more 
interested in hopping in and playing than making 
characters. Use the Archetypes as a base, then let 
the player fill in the more creative blanks—such as 
their hero’s name, where he comes from, and what’s 
special about him. 

If you’re the Game Master and you want to introduce 
new players to the game, use these to quickly fill out 
character sheets, then add some background and 
appropriate Hindrances to make them shine and 
you’re all set. 


19 

Races 
Not every hero is human. Below are sample races common 
to many science fiction and fantasy settings. Use them as they 
are or modify them to fit your particular world. Immediately 
after you’ll also find guidelines on how to create your own 
races. 

Android 

Androids are sentient machines with a variety of appearances 
depending on the setting. Some appear almost human, some 
are purely mechanical. The android presented here is a 
basic version with normal human knowledge and emotions. 
Particular settings may alter, remove, or add other abilities 
based on their role and function in that world. 

• 
Asimov Circuits: The android cannot harm, or by 
inaction bring harm to sentient beings. This gives him 
the Pacifist Hindrance (Major). 
• 
Construct: Androids add +2 to recover from being 
Shaken, don’t suffer wound modifiers, and are immune 
to poison and disease. Androids cannot heal naturally. To 
heal an android requires the Repair skill—which is used 
like the Healing skill only with no “Golden Hour.” 
• 
Outsider: Organic races often mistrust or misunderstand 
androids. They subtract 2 from their Charisma when 
dealing with races other than their own. 
• 
Programming: Androids begin with a free d6 in one skill, 
representing their original programmed role. 
• 
Recharge: During character creation, the player must 
determine the android’s power source. If the android 
cannot access his power source at least once per 
day, he’s automatically Fatigued each day until he’s 
Incapacitated. The day after that, he goes “off-line” and 
must be revived with a Repair roll and a four-hour charge 
of energy. The power source replaces the need for food 
and water, unless they are the chosen power source. 
• 
Unnatural: Arcane powers, both detrimental and 
beneficial, suffer a –2 penalty to affect androids. This 
has no effect on damaging powers, which affect them 
normally. 
Atlantean 

From the crushing depths come the mysterious folk known 
as Atlanteans. They are thick and sturdy beneath the waves 
but often vulnerable in the dry air or searing heat. Their 
civilization is advanced, and Atlantean science is a wonder 
to behold. 

• 
Advanced Civilization: Atlanteans are generally more 
intelligent than the other races of their world. They start 
with a d6 in Smarts rather than a d4. 
• 
Aquatic: Atlanteans live in and breathe water. They 
cannot drown in water, move at full Swimming skill, and 
get a free d6 Swimming. 
• 
Dehydration: Atlanteans must immerse themselves in 
water one hour out of every 24 or become automatically 
Fatigued each day until they are Incapacitated. The day 
after that, they perish. 
• 
Tough: The pressure of their deep homes make 
Atlanteans tougher than most. Increase Toughness by 1. 
Avion 

Avions are any basically human race with wings. They tend 
to be very slight of build owing to their hollow bones. 

• 
Flight: Avions can fly at their basic Pace and even “run” 
while flying. It costs 2” of Pace to gain 1” of height. 
• 
Hollow-boned: Avions have –1 Toughness. 
• 
Mostly Human: Avions may choose one free Edge at 
character creation as long as they meet all requirements. 
Dwarves 

Dwarves are short, stout, hardy people who come from 
massive caverns in the high mountains. They are a proud, 
warlike race, usually made so by frequent contact with savage 
races such as orcs and goblins. 

Dwarves usually live upwards of 200 years. In most fantasy 
campaigns, they have ruddy skin and all human hair colors. 

• 
Low Light Vision: Dwarven eyes are accustomed to the 
dark of the underearth. They ignore attack penalties for 
Dim and Dark lighting. 
• 
Slow: Dwarves have a Pace of 5”. 
• 
Tough: Dwarves are stout and tough. They start with a 
d6 Vigor instead of a d4. 
Elves 

Elves are tall, thin souls with pointed ears and deep-set 
eyes of various colors. Whether they hail from the forests or 
hidden valleys, they are all born more graceful than humans, 
though somewhat slighter. Most elves live upwards of 300 
years. They have fair skin and their hair includes all human 
colors, plus shades of silver and blue. 

• 
Agile: Elves are graceful and agile. They start with a d6 
in Agility instead of a d4. 
• 
All Thumbs: Elves have an inbred dislike of mechanical 
objects, and thus have the All Thumbs Hindrance. They 
shun most mechanical items and designs. 
• 
Low Light Vision: Elven eyes amplify light like a cat’s, 
allowing them to see in the dark. Elves ignores attack 
penalties for Dim and Dark lighting. 
Half-Elves 

Half-elves are usually a solid mix of their two parents. They 
gain the elves’ grace but none of their elegant frailty. 

Most half-elves are well-adjusted, but some are shunned by 
one side of the family or the other and grow resentful. Others 
may even be mistreated. 

Their lifespans are closer to their human parent than those 
of their elven kin. Most half-elves live only to about 100 years. 

• 
Heritage: Some half-elves retain the grace of their 
elven parent. Others gain the adaptability of their human 
ancestry. A half-elf may either start with a free Edge of 
his choice (as a human), or a d6 in Agility instead of a d4. 
• 
Low Light Vision: The character’s eyes amplify light 
like a cat’s, allowing him to see in the dark. He ignores 
attack penalties for Dim and Dark lighting. 
• 
Outsider: Half-elves aren’t true outsiders (as per the 
Hindrance of the same name), but neither are they ever 
quite comfortable around humans or elves as one of their 
own, so the effect is the same. 
20 

Half-Folk 

Half-folk are small, nimble creatures with fuzzy brown or 
black hair. Though they are frail compared to most other 
races, their cheerful optimism (or wily cunning) gives them a 
“never say die” attitude that makes them more than a match 
for creatures twice their size. 

Half-folk see no reason to invite trouble, and tend to live in 
their own little communities far off the beaten path. 

• 
Fortunate: Half-folk draw one additional Benny per game 
session. This may be combined with the Luck and Great 
Luck Edges. 
• 
Short: Half-folk average only about 4’ tall. This gives 
them a Size of –1 and subtracts 1 from their Toughness. 
• 
Spirited: Half-folk are generally optimistic beings. They 
start with a d6 Spirit instead of a d4. 
Half-Orcs 

Half-orcs are the offspring of either a human and an orc or 
an orc and another half-orc. Rarely is such a mating willingly 
accepted, so the character’s “family tree” is likely more than 
a little troublesome to him or her. 

Half-orcs are usually accepted by orcish communities, 
but are shunned by most other races, including 
humans, elves, and dwarves. Some half-orcs 
choose to join the “civilized” races, turning their 
backs on their barbaric roots, and are often looking 
to redeem themselves. Many are heroic souls trying to 
prove their worth. 

Half-orcs have light-colored human skin with just a tinge 
of orcish coloration, with black hair and small eyes. Their 
features are harsh and angular, like that of orcs. Their 
natural life-span is the same as humans, though it is 
rare when one dies of old age. 

• 
Infravision: Half-orcs can see in the 
infrared spectrum, halving attack penalties 
(round down) for bad lighting. 
• 
Outsider: Half-orcs aren’t trusted by most 
other civilized races, and so subtract 2 from 
their Charisma. 
• 
Strong: Half-orcs have some of the strength 
of their ancestry. They start with a d6 Strength 
attribute instead of a d4. 
Humans 

Humans in most settings should get the usual 
benefit — one free Edge of their choice. This option 
reflects their versatility and adaptability compared to 
other races. 

If you like more variety, you might also give humans 
abilities based on culture rather than race. For instance, a 
seafaring human culture may start with Boating and Swimming 
at d6. Cultural templates are designed just like making new 
races (see page 22). 

Rakashans 

Rakashans have the form of humans with the features of 
felines. They come in a wide variety: the bright colors of tigers, 
the speckled hides of leopards, and the exotic look of Siamese 

cats are all appropriate. They have sharp claws and teeth 
and a cruel nature when it comes to dealing with their prey. 

Rakashans can be found in their own remote and exotic 
cities or as fringe elements of normal society. While they are 
too beautiful to be shunned, they are too foreign to be easily 
accepted. 

• 
Agile: Rakashans have the feline grace of their ancestors. 
They start with a d6 Agility attribute instead of a d4. 
• 
Bloodthirsty: Rakashans can be cruel to their foes, often 
toying with them for simple amusement. They rarely take 
prisoners and feel little compunction about punishing 
captured foes. This causes a –4 Charisma penalty among 
more “civilized” types. 
• 
Racial Enemy: Rakashan society rose at the expense of 
another. Pick a common race in your setting. Members of 
each culture suffer a –4 Charisma when dealing with each 
other. Unless fettered by other authorities or common 
goals, individuals of the two races typically attack each 
other on sight. 
• Claws: Rakashans have retractable claws 
that do Str+d6 damage and grant +2 to Climbing 
rolls on all but completely sheer surfaces. 

• Low Light Vision: Rakashan eyes amplify 
light. They can see in the dark and ignore 
attack penalties for Dim and Dark lighting. 
Saurians 

Lizard men typically come from steaming 
jungles or deep deserts where they have 
unique civilizations unknown to other 

sentient races. 

Few outsiders have penetrated 
their society, and persistent 
rumors that Saurian religion 
requires sentient sacrifices remain 
unconfirmed. 

• Outsider: Most 
races distrust the unblinking 
saurians. Their habit 
of eating their meat still 

squirming is also less than 
appetizing. They suffer a –2 
Charisma penalty. 

• Natural Weapons: The 
tails, claws, and teeth of saurians 
allow them to tail slap, claw, or bite in 
combat for Str+d4 damage. 

• Saurian Senses: Saurians’ lizard 
tongues can “taste” the air, giving them +2 
to Notice rolls. They are always considered 
active guards for Stealth checks. 

• Warm Natured: Though not truly 
cold-blooded, saurians are not comfortable in 
cold environments. They suffer a –4 penalty 
to resist cold environmental effects. 
21 

Making Races 


The following system allows you to make new races or 
cultural templates like those found on the previous pages. 
The Game Master can use this to create pre-built races for 
his world, or allow players to do so if the setting allows a great 
number of racial variations. 

If you’re the Game Master, decide on the maximum number 
of Racial Edge points allowed (usually between 2 and 4). This 
provides enough scope to make an interesting race or culture 
without unduly unbalancing the game. 

Races and cultures begin with a free +2 Racial Ability. This 
is equivalent to a human’s Free Edge. Additional positive 
abilities must be countered with an equal value of negative 
ones. A +2 ability, for example, may be countered by a single 
–2 ability or two –1 abilities. 

Give each ability a suitable name. If you want your horse 
nomads to have Riding skill at d6, call it Born to the Saddle. 
It’s all about creating a rich flavor rather than just giving long 
lists of abilities your players have to keep up with. Short and 
flavorful is far preferable to long and comprehensive. 

If you want to include an ability we haven’t listed here, simply 
assign it a value based on the examples here.

Skills Skills 
On the following pages are skills available in most Savage 
Settings. Normal use of a skill—guiding a boat in and out of 
a dock, repairing an engine with plenty of time and the proper 
tools, or riding a horse across a prairie—shouldn’t require a 
skill roll. Only when a character is under pressure to perform 
a task quickly, or has a significant chance of failure and can’t 
just keep trying until he’s successful, should his player be 
asked to roll. 

Familiarization 

Skills are very broad for ease of play, but sometimes it’s 
dramatically appropriate to emphasize when a character is 
out of his element. 

When a hero finds himself using a skill in a dramatically 
different way than he’s used to, he suffers a –2 penalty to 
his rolls. How long this lasts depends on the skill, but should 
typically be at least a few days of casual use, or a few hours 
of more intensive use. 

What a character is familiar with should be based on his 
background and any character history the player has written 
up, with the Game Master having the final say. 

If you want more in-depth rules, see the Skill Specialization 
Setting Rules on page 95. 

Common Knowledge

Instead of asking characters to have dozens of background 
skills they rarely need in actual play, we use the concept of 
“Common Knowledge.” Your hero knows the basic history of 
his land, common etiquette, how to get around geographically, 
how to operate common machinery or equipment native to 
his time period and location, and who the major players in 
his locality are. A Common Knowledge roll is made by rolling 
the adventurer’s Smarts attribute. 

If a character’s background suggests he should know 
something about a subject and he must make a roll, add +2 
if most in his area or profession would know the answer. If 
the subject is foreign to a character, subtract 2 or more from 
the roll. Everyone else breaks even and gets no modifier. 

If it becomes important to know how well a character 
performs a common task, the GM can ask for whatever roll 
is appropriate. Knowing how to do a dance, for example, is a 
Common Knowledge roll. If it becomes important to see how 
well a character performs the dance, the GM might ask for 
an Agility roll (with no bonuses or penalties). 

For example, an adventure might read: “Anyone who makes 
a Common Knowledge roll detects that this cavern was carved 
by civilized hands, not formed naturally.” A dwarf knows more 
about stonework than an elf, so give the dwarf a +2 on the 
roll. A human has about average knowledge, so no bonus is 
granted. An elf who has spent most of his life in a forest won’t 
know much about stonework, so the roll is at a –2 penalty. 

Specific Knowledge 

The Knowledge skill represents deeper specialization in 
a chosen subject. A dwarf with Knowledge (Stonework), for 
example, not only knows the dungeon was carved, but might 
just know what race did it and the era in which it was first 
excavated. He might also be able to locate stress points that 
can cause a cave-in! Knowledge of a particular region is also 
handy. In a fantasy campaign, for example, locals might know 
the Dread Mountains are home to vicious harpies. A hero with 
Knowledge (Dread Mountains) might know a safe route the 
specific peak the creatures’ aerie is in. 

Knowledge skills should be used for subjects that have a 
significant impact during the game. If the subject comes up 
very rarely, use Common Knowledge instead.

Skill List 
Climbing Modifiers 



Boating (Agility)

Characters with this skill can handle most any boat or ship 
common to their setting and character background. They 
generally know how to handle common tasks associated with 
their vessels as well (tying knots, rigging sails, etc.). 

Climbing (Strength)

Characters may sometimes have to climb tall objects under 
duress, perhaps to scale a cliff to attack archers stationed 
above, or to evade a terrifying creature on the ground below! 

No roll is usually needed to ascend ladders, ropes, or trees 
with lots of limbs unless the GM feels there’s a good reason 
(being chased, wounded, etc.). In more stressful situations, a 
character makes a Climbing roll and checks the results below. 
Remember that these measurements are listed in table-top 
inches, with each inch representing two yards in the real world. 

• 
Fail: The character makes no progress. If the Climbing 
roll is a total of 1 or less, he falls to the next level below— 
whatever that may be. See Falling damage on page 88. 
If the hero was secured by a rope or other restraint, he 
falls half the length of the restraint and suffers a Fatigue 
level instead. 
• 
Success: The hero ascends a number of vertical inches 
on the table-top equal to half his Strength. A hero with a 
d6 Strength, for example, can climb 3” in a round if he 
makes his Climbing roll. 
• 
Raise: As Success, above, but the character moves an 
additional 2”. 
Modifier 
Situation 

+2 Antique or medieval climbing equipment 
+4 Modern climbing equipment 
–2 Scarce or thin handholds 
–2 Wet or slippery surface 

. Falling Damage: See page 88. 
. Prepared Climbs: Break lengthy ascents into three 
roughly even sections. Failing a Climbing roll after a break 
point typically means the hero falls that distance if free-
climbing. 
. Ropes: Those secured with a rope typically only suffer a 
level of Fatigue from Bumps and Bruises (see page 86). Of 
course the Game Master might decide the rope has a chance 
of breaking under a sudden strain. This is rare in reality, but 
for dramatic effect, roll a d6. On a 1, the rope breaks and the 
character falls the entire length of the last section climbed. 
Driving (Agility)

Driving allows your hero to control ground and hover vehicles 
common to his setting. Rules for handling vehicles on the 
table-top can be found on page 98. Driving is also frequently 
used with the Chase rules, described on page 82. 

Fighting (Agility)

Fighting covers all hand-to-hand (melee) attacks, whether 
it’s with fists, axes, laser swords, or martial arts. The TN to hit 
an opponent is his Parry (2 plus half his Fighting). See Chapter 
Three for the combat rules and numerous maneuvers your 
warrior might attempt. 

24 

Gambling (Smarts)

Gambling is useful from the saloons of the Old West to the 
barracks of most armies. Here’s a quick way to simulate about 
a half-hour of gambling without having to roll for every single 
toss of the dice or hand of cards. 

First have everyone agree on the stakes, such as $10, 
10 gold coins, etc. Now have everyone in the game make 
a Gambling roll. The lowest total pays the highest total the 
difference times the stake. The next lowest pays the second 
highest the difference times the stake, and so on. If there’s 
an odd man left in the middle, he breaks even. 

Example: Kali rolls highest with a 10 and Yuri rolls 
lowest with a 4. The difference is 6, so Yuri pays Kali 
6 x the stake of $10, or $60. 

. 
Cheating: A character who cheats adds +2 to his roll. 
The GM may raise or lower this modifier depending on the 
particulars of the game or the method of cheating. If the player 
ever rolls a 1 on his skill die (regardless of his Wild Die), he’s 
caught. The consequences of this depend on the setting, but 
are usually quite harsh. 
Design Note -Guts 
Where did the Guts skill go? We removed it. It’s 

important to some settings (and you’ll find it as a 
Setting Rule when it is), but rare in others. Where it’s 
rare, however, even a mighty barbarian has to spend 
valuable skill points to prove his mettle with the Guts 

skill, and that really doesn’t make much sense. 
In the core rules and most settings (especially 

fantasy and sci-fi) characters now use Spirit to resist 
the effects of Fear. If a character in a previously 

published setting has Guts, ignore it. If you’re using 

a published adventure that requires a Guts roll, use 

Spirit instead. 

In a few settings (primarily horrific ones, like 
Deadlands), Guts is a Setting Rule that reflects the 
particular nature of the game world and remains intact. 

Healing (Smarts)

Healing is the art of stopping wounds and treating existing 
injuries. In general, every success and raise on a Healing roll 
eliminates a wound. The healer must subtract not only his own 
wounds from the roll as usual, but those of his patient as well. 

See the Healing rules on page 78 for specific information. 

Intimidation (Spirit)

Intimidation is the art of frightening an opponent with sheer 
force of will, veiled or overt threats, or sometimes just really big 
guns. This is an opposed roll between the hero’s Intimidation 
and his opponent’s Spirit. See Tests of Will on page 75 for 
game effects. 

Investigation (Smarts)

A character skilled in Investigation knows how to make good 
use of libraries, newspaper morgues, the internet, or other 
written sources of information. To get information from people 
rather than books and computers, use the Streetwise skill. 

Knowledge (Smarts)

Knowledge is a catch-all skill that must have a focus of 
some sort, such as Knowledge (Occult) or Knowledge 
(Science). The player can choose the focus of his character’s 
knowledge, which might reflect his background and education. 
The skill can be taken multiple times with different focuses 
to reflect different areas of expertise. An archaeologist, for 
example, should have Knowledge (History) and Knowledge 
(Archaeology). 

General focuses such as Knowledge (Science) are 
acceptable, but the GM should give a bonus to a character 
who has a focus more relevant to a particular task, such as 
using Knowledge (Biology) to identify a plant or animal. 

Some Common Knowledge focuses are: Area Knowledge, 
Battle (used in Mass Battles, see page 92), Computers, 
Electronics, History, Journalism, various languages, Law, 
Medicine (though actually caring for someone is the Healing 
skill), or Science. 

. 
Common Knowledge: Characters don’t need a Knowledge 
skill to know something about a particular field. Basic 
information should be covered by Common Knowledge 
(see page 23) assuming it makes sense within a character’s 
background. A mercenary with a penchant for reading or a 
young history student, for example, doesn’t necessarily need 
Knowledge (History). If tasked with a historical question, 
however, the two might roll normally while those without such 
a background roll at a penalty. 
. 
Languages: Knowledge can also be used to reflect 
knowing a language other than one’s own. The higher the 
level, the better the character can speak and mimic regional 
dialects, as shown below. 
In settings where inhabitants typically speak many 
languages, see the Languages Setting Rule on page 94. 

Knowledge (Language) Table 

Skill Ability 

d4 The character can read, write, and speak common 
words and phrases 
d6 The speaker can carry on a prolonged but 
occasionally halting conversation 
d8 The character can speak fluently 
d10 The hero can mimic other dialects within the 
language 
d12 The speaker can masterfully recite important 

literary or oral works 

Lockpicking (Agility)

Lockpicking is the ability to bypass mechanical and 
electronic locks. Lockpicking is also used to disarm the 
catches and triggers on traps, unless a more relevant skill 
seems appropriate for a particular trap. 

Notice (Smarts)

Notice is a hero’s general alertness and ability to search 
for items or clues. This covers hearing rolls, detecting 
ambushes, spotting hidden weapons and even scrutinizing 
other characters to see if they’re lying, frightened, and so on. 
The more raises a character gets on a Notice roll, the more 
information the Game Master should reveal. 

25 

Persuasion (Spirit)

Persuasion is the ability to convince others to do what you 
want them to do. 

Nonplayer characters start at one of five different attitudes: 
Hostile, Uncooperative, Neutral, Friendly, or Helpful. A 
successful Persuasion roll improves the Extra’s attitude one 
step, or two with a raise. Failure, on the other hand, decreases 
the character’s attitude by a step, or two if a 1 is rolled on the 
Persuasion die (regardless of the Wild Die). Most Extras won’t 
change their reaction more than one or two levels during a 
single exchange, but that’s entirely up to the Game Master 
and the situation. 

. 
Charisma: Persuasion is always modified by a character’s 
Charisma. 
. 
Player Characters: Persuasion should never be used on 
other player characters. Their attitudes should be decided 
entirely by their players. 
. 
Reaction Table: If the Game Master doesn’t already 
have an initial attitude in mind for the Extra, he can roll on 
the chart below. 
Reaction Table 
2d6 Initial Reaction 

2 Hostile: The target is openly hostile and does his best 
to stand in the hero’s way. He won’t help without an 
overwhelming reward or payment of some kind. 

3-4 Uncooperative: The target isn’t willing to help unless 
there’s a significant advantage to himself. 

5-9 Neutral: The target has no particular attitude and will 
help for little reward if the task at hand is very easy. If 
the task is difficult, he’ll require substantial payment 
of some kind. 

10-11 Friendly: The target will go out of his way for the hero. 
He’ll likely do easy tasks for free (or very little), and 
is willing to do more dangerous tasks for fair pay or 
other favors. 

12 Helpful: The target is anxious to help the hero, and 
will probably do so for little or no pay depending on 
the nature of the task. 

Piloting (Agility)

Piloting allows a character to fly airplanes, helicopters, jet 
packs, and any other flying devices common to his setting 
and background. 

Repair (Smarts)

Repair is the ability to fix gadgets, vehicles, weapons, and 
other machines. Characters suffer a –2 penalty to their rolls 
if they don’t have access to basic tools. A raise on a Repair 
roll halves the time required by the specific task. 

Riding (Agility)

Riding allows a hero to mount, control, and ride any beast 
common to his setting. Players should note that mounted 
characters use the lowest of their Fighting or Riding skills 
when fighting from horseback. Additional rules for fighting 
while mounted can be found on page 73. 

Shooting (Agility)

Shooting covers all attempts to hit a target with a ranged 
weapon such as a bow, pistol, or rocket launcher. The basic 
Target Number to hit is 4 as usual, though there are a number 
of important modifiers such as range that frequently come into 
play. See Chapter Three for more details. 

Stealth (Agility)

Stealth is the ability to both hide and move quietly, as well 
as palm objects and pick pockets. In many Savage Worlds 
games, knowing exactly when your hero has been spotted 
and when he hasn’t can be critical. 

For a character to sneak up on foes and infiltrate enemy 
lines, start by figuring out if the “guards” the heroes are 
sneaking up on are “active” or “inactive.” Inactive guards aren’t 
paying particularly close attention to their surroundings. The 
group need only score a standard success on their individual 
Stealth rolls to avoid being seen. Failing a Stealth roll in the 
presence of inactive guards makes them active. 

Active guards make opposed Notice rolls against the 
sneaking characters’ Stealth skills. Failing a roll against active 
guards means the character is spotted. 

Apply the following modifiers to all Stealth rolls: 

26 

Stealth Modifiers 
Situation Modifier 

Crawling +2 
Running –2 
Dim light +1 
Darkness +2 
Pitch darkness +4 
Light cover +1 
Medium cover +2 
Heavy cover +4 


. The Last Step: Sneaking to within 6” of a foe (usually to 
get close enough for a melee attack) requires an opposed 
Stealth roll versus the target’s Notice, whether the guard is 
active or inactive. 
. Movement Rate: Out of combat, each Stealth roll covers 
moving up to five times the character’s Pace. In combat, the 
Stealth roll covers only a single round of movement. 
. Stealth for Groups: Out of combat, make only one Stealth 
roll for each like group of characters (see Group Rolls on page 
63). Use the lowest movement rate to determine how much 
ground is covered. The observers also make a group roll to 
Notice their foes. Once a combat breaks down into rounds, 
Stealth and Notice rolls are made on an individual basis. 
Streetwise (Smarts)

Streetwise characters are able to gather information from 
the street, saloons, or other contacts through bribes, threats, 
or carousing. Finding written information in libraries and the 
like is covered by the Investigation skill. Streetwise is always 
modified by a character’s Charisma modifier. 

Survival (Smarts)

Survival allows a character to find food, water, or shelter in 
hostile environments. A character may only make one roll per 
day. A successful roll finds sustenance for one person, a raise 
on the roll finds food and water for five adults. Horses and 
other large beasts count as two adults. Children, camels or 
others with small appetites count as half. Those who benefit 
from the roll do not have to make Fatigue rolls for the day for 
food, water, or shelter. 

Swimming (Agility)

Swimming determines if a character floats or sinks in water, 
as well as how fast he can move within it. A character’s Pace is 
half his Swimming skill in inches per turn in normal water (round 
up). Choppy water counts as rough terrain and halves this rate. 
Characters may not “run” while swimming for extra movement. 

. Holding Your Breath: Characters can hold their breath 
for a number of rounds equal to 2 plus their Vigor die, or half 
that if they weren’t prepared for being submerged and didn’t 
have time to get a good breath. 
. Drowning: The rules for drowning are found on page 87. 
Taunt (Smarts)

Taunt is a Test of Wills attack against a person’s pride 
through ridicule, cruel jokes, or one-upmanship. This is an 
opposed roll against the target’s Smarts. See Tests of Will on 
page 75 for the effects of a successful Taunt. 

Throwing (Agility)

Throwing governs all sorts of thrown weapons, from hand 
grenades to knives, axes, and spears. Throwing works just like 
the Shooting skill, and uses all the same modifiers, including 
those for Range. The Rate of Fire of a thrown attack is 1 per 
hand, so a human character could throw two items at once 
(one with each hand), suffering the usual multi-action and 
off-hand penalties (see page 75). 

Tracking (Smarts)

Tracking allows a character to follow the tracks of one or 
more individuals in any type of terrain. Each roll generally 
covers following the tracks for one mile, but the GM may adjust 
this dramatically for more specific or small scale searches. 

Tracking Modifiers 

Modifier Situation 

+2 Tracking more than 5 individuals 

+4 Recent snow 

+2 Mud 

+1 Dusty area 

–4 Raining 

–2 Tracking in poor light 

–2 Tracks are more than one day old 

–2 Target attempted to hide tracks 

27 

Hindrances 


Hindrances are character flaws and physical handicaps 
that occasionally make life a little tougher for your hero. 
Some Hindrances are more or less subjective (such as 
Overconfident). They’re there to help you roleplay your 
character, and might even net you more Bennies since the 
Game Master awards them for properly playing your character. 

A character may take one Major Hindrance and up to two 
Minor Hindrances. You’re free to take more if you think they 
fit your character description, but you don’t get additional 
points for them. 

Design Note - Roleplaying Hindrances 

Some Hindrances impose game penalties and some 
only really matter if the player roleplays them. That’s 

intentional and not something you should worry about 
too much. The game is designed with the assumption 

that all heroes take their full complement of Hindrances 

and therefore have two additional attribute points, 

Edges, skills, or a combination thereof. 
It’s certainly true that a Hindrance like Big Mouth 

won’t be worth much if the player doesn’t occasionally 

roleplay it by blurting things out at inappropriate times. 
But the Game Master can pay a little attention here, 
too. For example, in a fantasy campaign, players don’t 
roleplay every minute their characters are in a tavern. 

But it’s easy to assume that while they’re there— 
whether it was acted out or not—the Big Mouthed hero 

let spill their plans to raid the ancient tomb on the hill. 

Maybe the group will find another team of adventurers 
are there before them—or worse, waiting to see what 
they found when they come out. 

Finally, Hindrances are more about helping a 

player figure out who his character is than inflicting 

a gameplay penalty on him. Being Loyal may never 

really be a problem—most characters are just 

naturally loyal to others in their party. But having it 
on the character sheet reminds the player that he’s 

a “good guy,” at least to his friends, and will help him 

indirectly roleplay his character and make decisions 

within that context he might have made differently if 
he was Mean instead. 

All Thumbs (Minor)

Some people just aren’t good with modern devices. 
Characters with this drawback suffer a –2 penalty to the Repair 
skill at all times. In addition, when a hero uses a mechanical 
or electronic device, a roll of 1 on his skill die (regardless of 
his Wild Die) means the device is broken. The damage usually 
requires a Repair roll at –2 and 1d6 hours to fix. 

Anemic (Minor)

An anemic character is particularly susceptible to sickness, 
disease, environmental effects, and fatigue. He subtracts 2 
from all Fatigue checks such as those made to resist poison 
and disease. (See page 86 for more information on Fatigue 
and the various hazards that lead to it.) 

Arrogant (Major)

Your hero doesn’t think he’s the best—he knows he is. Whatever 
it is—swordsmanship, kung fu, running—few compare to his skills 
and he flaunts it every chance he gets. 

Winning just isn’t enough for your hero. He must completely 
dominate his opponent. Anytime there is even a shadow of 
a doubt as to who is better, he must humiliate his opponent 
and prove he can snatch victory any time he wishes. He is 
the kind of man who disarms an opponent in a duel just so he 
can pick the sword up and hand it back with a smirk. 

Arrogant heroes always look for the “boss” in battle, 
attacking lesser minions only if they get in the way. 

Bad Eyes (Minor or Major)

Your hero’s eyes just aren’t what they used to be. With 
glasses, there’s no penalty and the Hindrance is only Minor. 
Should he lose his glasses (generally a 50% chance when 
he’s wounded, or no chance with a “nerd-strap”), he suffers a 
–2 penalty to any Trait roll made to shoot or Notice something 
more than 5” (10 yards) distant. 

In low-tech settings where the hero cannot wear glasses, 
Bad Eyes is a Major Hindrance. He must subtract 2 from Trait 
rolls made to attack or notice things 5” or more away. 

Bad Luck (Major)

Your hero is a little less lucky than most. He gets one less 
Benny per game session than normal. A character cannot 
have both Bad Luck and the Luck Edge. 

Big Mouth (Minor)

Loose lips sink ships, the saying goes. Your hero’s mouth 
could drown an armada. 

Your character can’t keep a secret very well. He reveals 
plans and gives away things best kept among friends, usually 
at the worst possible times. 

Blind (Major)

The individual is completely without sight. He suffers a –6 to 
all physical tasks that require vision (which is most everything) 
and –2 to most social tasks as he can’t “read” those he’s 
interacting with as well as others. 

On the plus side, Blind characters gain their choice of a free 
Edge to compensate for this particularly difficult Hindrance. 

Bloodthirsty (Major)

Your hero never takes prisoners unless under the direct 
supervision of a superior. This can cause major problems in 
a military campaign unless his superiors condone that sort 
of thing. Your killer suffers –4 to his Charisma, but only if his 
cruel habits are known. 

Cautious (Minor)

Some folks gather too much intelligence. This character 
personifies over-cautiousness. He never makes rash 
decisions and likes to plot things out in detail long before any 
action is taken. 

Clueless (Major)

Your hero isn’t as aware of his world as most others. He 
suffers –2 to Common Knowledge rolls. 

28 

Code of Honor (Major)

Honor is very important to your character. He keeps his word, 
won’t abuse or kill prisoners, and generally tries to operate 
within his world’s particular notion of proper gentlemanly or 
ladylike behavior. 

Curious (Major)

It killed the cat, and it might kill your hero as well. Curious 
characters are easily dragged into any adventure. They have 
to check out everything and always want to know what’s 
behind a potential mystery. 

Death Wish (Minor)

Having a death wish doesn’t mean your adventurer is 
suicidal—but he does want to die after completing some 
important goal. Maybe he wants revenge for the murder 
of his family, or maybe he’s dying from disease and 
wants to go out in a blaze of glory. He won’t throw his 
life away for no reason, but when there’s a chance 
to complete his goal, he’ll do anything—and take any 
risk—to achieve it. 

This Hindrance is usually Minor unless the goal 
is relatively easily fulfilled (very rare). 

Delusional (Minor or Major)

Your hero believes something that is 
considered quite strange by everyone 
else. Minor Delusions are harmless or the 
character generally keeps it to himself (the 
government puts sedatives in soft drinks, 
dogs can talk, we’re all just characters in 
some bizarre game, etc.). 

With a Major Delusion, he expresses 
his view on the situation frequently and 
it can occasionally lead to 
danger (the government is 
run by aliens, hospitals are 
deadly, I’m allergic to armor, 
zombies are my friends). 

Doubting Thomas (Minor)

Some people don’t believe in the 
supernatural until they’re halfway down 
some creature’s gullet. Doubting Thomases 
are skeptics who try their best to rationalize 
supernatural events. Even once a Doubting 
Thomas realizes the supernatural exists, 
he still tries to rationalize weird events, 
following red herrings or ignoring evidence. 

Doubting Thomases suffer –2 to their 
Fear checks when confronted with 
undeniable supernatural horror. 

Elderly (Major)

Your adventurer is getting on in 
years, but he’s not quite ready for the 
nursing home. His Pace is reduced by 
1, and his Strength and Vigor drop 
a die type to a minimum of d4, and 
cannot be raised thereafter. 

On the plus side, the wisdom of his years grants the hero 
5 extra skill points that may be used for any skills linked to 
Smarts. 

Enemy (Minor or Major)

Someone out there hates the character and wants him dead. 
The value of the Hindrance depends on how powerful the 
enemy is and how often he might show up. A Minor Enemy 
might be a lone gunslinger out for vengeance. A Major Enemy 
might be a supernatural gunslinger who wants your hero dead. 

If the enemy is one day defeated, the GM should gradually 
work in a replacement, or the hero may buy off the Hindrance 
by sacrificing an Advance. 

Greedy (Minor or Major)

Your miserly hero measures his worth in treasure. 
If a Minor Hindrance, he argues bitterly over any 
loot acquired during play. If a Major Hindrance, he 

fights over anything he considers unfair, and may 
even kill for his “fair share.” 

Habit (Minor or Major)

Your warrior has an annoying and 
constant habit of some sort. Maybe 
she picks her nose, says “y’know” 
in every sentence, or chews gum 
like it’s going out of style. 

A Minor Habit irritates those 
around her but isn’t dangerous. 
Your hero suffers a –1 Charisma. 

A Major Habit is a physical or 
mental addiction of some sort that is 
debilitating or possibly even deadly. This 
includes drug use, chronic drinking, or 
perhaps even an addiction to virtual reality 
in a high-tech setting. A character who 
doesn’t get his fix must make a Fatigue 
check every 24 hours thereafter (see 
Fatigue on page 86). The first failed 
roll makes the character Fatigued, 
then Exhausted. The final result is a 
coma for hard drug use, or a bad case 
of the shakes for things like alcohol 
or VR. Medical care may ease the 
symptoms. Otherwise the victim must 
live with the penalties for 1d6 days. 
Afterward, the hero must buy off the 

Hindrance by sacrificing an opportunity 
to Advance or he eventually falls back 
into his dependency. 

Hard of Hearing (Minor or Major)

Characters who have lost some or all of their 
hearing have this disadvantage. As a Minor 
Hindrance, it subtracts 2 from all Notice rolls 
made to hear, including awaking due to loud 
noises. AMajor Hindrance means the character 
is deaf. She cannot hear and automatically 
fails all Notice rolls that depend on hearing. 

29 

Heroic (Major)

This noble soul never says no to a person in need. She 
doesn’t have to be happy about it, but she always comes to 
the rescue of those she feels can’t help themselves. She’s 
the first one to run into a burning building, usually agrees to 
hunt monsters for little or no pay, and is generally a pushover 
for a sob story. 

Illiterate (Minor)

Your hero cannot read. He can probably sign his name and 
knows what a STOP sign says, but can do little else. He also 
doesn’t know much about math either. He can probably do 
2+2=4, but multiplication and the like are beyond him. 

Illiterates can’t read or write in any language, by the way, 
no matter how many they actually speak. 

Lame (Major)

A past wound has nearly crippled your hero. His basic Pace 
is reduced by 2 and he rolls only a d4 for running rolls. A 
character’s Pace may never be reduced below 1. 

Loyal (Minor)

Your character may not be a hero, but he’d give his life for 
his friends. This character can never leave a man behind if 
there’s any chance at all he could help. 

Mean (Minor)

This fellow is ill-tempered and disagreeable. No one really 
likes him, and he has trouble doing anything kind for anyone 
else. He must be paid for his troubles and doesn’t even accept 
awards graciously. Your character suffers –2 to his Charisma. 

Obese (Minor)

Particularly large people often have great difficulty in 
dangerous physical situations. Those who carry their weight 
well have the Brawny Edge. Those who don’t handle it very 
well are Obese. A character cannot be both Brawny and 
Obese. 

An Obese hero adds 1 to his Toughness, but his Pace is 
decreased by 1 and his running die is a d4. Obese characters 
may also have difficulty finding armor or clothing that fits, 
squeezing into tight spaces, or even riding in confined spaces 
such as coach airplane seats or compact cars. 

One Arm (Major)

Whether by birth or battle, your hero has lost an arm. 
Fortunately, his other arm is (now) his “good” one. Tasks that 
require two hands, such as Climbing, suffer a –4 modifier. 

One Eye (Major)

Your hero lost an eye for some unfortunate reason. If he 
doesn’t wear a patch or buy a glass replacement (typically 
$500), he suffers –1 to his Charisma for the grotesque wound. 

He suffers –2 to any Trait rolls that require depth perception, 
such as Shooting or Throwing, jumping a ravine or rooftop, 
and so on. 

One Leg (Major)

With a prosthetic, One Leg acts exactly like the Lame 
Hindrance, reducing Pace by 2 and running rolls are now a 

d4. Without a prosthetic, the character’s Pace is 2 and he can 
never run. He also suffers –2 to Traits that require mobility, 
such as Climbing and Fighting. A character with one leg also 
suffers a –2 penalty to his Swimming skill (and Pace). 

Outsider (Minor)

In a society made up of only a few types of people, your 
hero isn’t one of them. An Indian in a Western town, an alien 
in a sci-fi game of human marines, or a half-orc in a party of 
elves, dwarves, and humans are all examples of outsiders. 
Locals are likely to raise prices on the Outsider, ignore pleas 
for help, and generally treat him as if he’s of a lower class 
than the rest of their society. 

In addition to the roleplaying effects above, your hero’s 
Charisma suffers a –2 modifier among all but his own people. 

Overconfident (Major)

There’s nothing out there your hero can’t defeat. At least 
that’s what he thinks. He believes he can do most anything 
and never wants to retreat from a challenge. He’s not suicidal, 
but he certainly takes on more than common sense dictates. 

Pacifist (Minor or Major)

Your hero absolutely despises violence. Minor pacifism 
means he only fights when given no other choice, and never 
allows the killing of prisoners or other defenseless victims. 

Major Pacifists won’t fight living characters under any 
circumstances. They may defend themselves, but won’t do 
anything to permanently harm sentient, living creatures. Note 
that undeniably evil creatures, undead, demons, and the like 
are fair game. A Major Pacifist might also fight with nonlethal 
methods, such as with his fists. Such characters only do so 
when obviously threatened, however. 

Phobia (Minor or Major)

Phobias are overwhelming and irrational fears that stay with 
a hero for the rest of his life. Whenever a character is in the 
presence of his phobia, he subtracts 2 from all his Trait tests 
as a Minor Hindrance, and 4 if the fear is a Major Phobia. 

Phobias shouldn’t be too obvious—everyone should be 
afraid of vampires, for example, so it’s not a phobia—it’s 
common sense. Instead, the phobia usually centers on 
some random element the mind focused on during whatever 
encounter caused such a fright. Remember, phobias are 
irrational fears. 

Poverty (Minor)

It’s said a fool and his money are soon parted. Your hero is 
that fool. He starts with half the usual money for your setting 
and just can’t seem to hang onto funds acquired after play 
begins. In general, the player halves his total funds every 
game week. 

Quirk (Minor)

Your hero has some minor foible that is usually humorous, 
but can occasionally cause him trouble. A swashbuckler 
may always try to first slash his initials on his foes before 
attacking, a dwarf may brag constantly about his culture, or 
a snobby debutante might not eat, drink, or socialize with the 
lower class. 

30 

Small (Major)

Your character is either very skinny, very short, or both 
relative to his particular race. Subtract 1 from his Toughness 
for his reduced stature. 

Stubborn (Minor)

This stubborn individual always wants his way and never 
admits he’s wrong. Even when it’s painfully obvious he’s 
made a mistake he tries to justify it with half-truths and 
rationalizations. 

Ugly (Minor)

Unfortunately, this individual hit more than a few ugly sticks 
on his way down the tree of life. His Charisma is lowered by 2, 
and he is generally shunned by members of the opposite sex. 

Vengeful (Minor or Major)

Your character always attempts to right a wrong he feels 
was done to him. If this is a Minor Hindrance, he usually seeks 
vengeance legally. The type and immediacy of his vengeance 
varies by character, of course. Some plot and scheme for 
months to extract what they see as justice. Others demand 
immediate results. 

If this is a Major Hindrance, your character will kill to rectify 
his perceived injustice. 

Vow (Minor or Major)

The character has a vow of some sort. Whether it’s Major 
or Minor depends on the Vow itself. Some may have Vows to 
particular orders or causes, to the Hippocratic Oath, to rid the 
world of evil, and so on. The danger in fulfilling the Vow and 
how often it might occur determines the level of the Hindrance. 
Whatever the Vow, it’s only a Hindrance if it actually comes 
into play from time to time and causes the character some 
discomfort. 

Wanted (Minor or Major)

Your hero has committed some crime in his past and will be 
arrested if discovered by the authorities. This assumes the 
setting actually has laws and police officers to enforce them. 

The level of the Hindrance depends on how serious the 
crime was. A hero with numerous unpaid parking tickets (in a 
game where he might have to drive occasionally) has a Minor 
Hindrance, as does someone wanted for more serious crimes 
away from the main campaign area. Being accused of murder 
is a Major Hindrance in almost any setting. 

Yellow (Major)

Not everyone has ice water in his veins. Your hero is 
squeamish at the sight of blood and gore and terrified of 
coming to harm. He subtracts 2 from all of his fear-based 
Spirit checks. 

Young (Major)

Children are sometimes forced to go on dangerous 
adventures through unfortunate circumstances. Think 
carefully before choosing this Hindrance, for your youngster 
starts at a significant disadvantage. 

Young heroes are generally 8–12 years old (in human 
years—adjust this for races with different aging paradigms). 
They have only 3 points to adjust their attributes and 10 skill 
points. On the plus side, youths like these have a fair amount 
of luck. They draw one extra Benny at the beginning of each 
game session in addition to any additional Bennies gained 
from such things as the Luck or Great Luck Edges. 

If the character should live long enough to mature, the 
Hindrance doesn’t have to be bought off, he’s already paid the 
price for the Hindrance by starting at a disadvantage. He stops 
getting the extra Benny when he reaches 18 years of age 
however (or the age of adulthood in your particular setting). 

31 

Edges 
Below is a list of Edges common to most settings. You’ll 
find more Edges in official Savage Worlds setting books as 
well. The Edges are grouped by type to help during character 
creation. Unless an Edge specifically says otherwise, it may 
only be selected once. 

. 
Requirements: Below each Edge are any skills and Rank 
required to take it. A Novice character can’t buy a Legendary 
Edge, for instance. A character may always purchase an Edge 
of a Rank lower than his. 
. 
Improved Edges: Some Edges have improved effects if 
you purchase additional “levels” in them, such as Attractive 
and Very Attractive, or Rich and Filthy Rich. To buy an 
Improved Edge, you must have all previous versions of an 
Edge. You must choose Rich before buying Filthy Rich, for 
example. 
Background Edges 

These Edges are hereditary and background advantages or 
learned responses that develop in a character after prolonged 
training or exposure to certain events. 

Players can choose these Edges after character creation but 
the Game Master might require a little more rationalization. 
An individual might choose the Attractive Edge, for example, 
by cleaning herself up, getting a makeover, and generally 
paying more attention to her looks. Characters might be able 
to gain the Arcane Background Edge as well, should they find 
a book of forbidden knowledge or train under another arcane 
type in their party. 

Design Note - Background Edges 
In previous versions of Savage Worlds, Background 
Edges could only be taken at character creation 


without special permission by the Game Master. We’ve 
changed that rule and you may now take Background 
Edges as advances just like any other. If you care 
about the rationalization of such things, you may want 
to link them to an event in your game. If a player wants 

the Fast Healer Edge, for example, you might say (or 

the Game Master might require) that exposure to the 
party’s magical healing, or a new emphasis on health 
and fitness, have given the hero this ability. 

Alertness 

Requirements: Novice 

Not much gets by your hero. He’s very observant and 
perceptive, and adds +2 to his Notice rolls to hear, see, or 
otherwise sense the world around him. 

Ambidextrous 

Requirements: Novice, Agility d8+ 

Your hero is as deft with his left hand as he is with his right. 
Characters normally suffer a –2 penalty when performing 
physical tasks with the off-hand (characters are assumed to 
be right-handed). With this Edge, your warrior ignores the –2 
penalty for using his off-hand (see page 75). 

Arcane Background

Requirements: Novice, Special 

This is the Edge your character must purchase to have 
any sort of magical, psionic, or other supernatural ability. 
See Chapter Five for a complete description of Arcane 
Backgrounds. 

Arcane Resistance 

Requirements: Novice, Spirit d8+ 

This individual is particularly resistant to magic (including 
psionics, weird science, etc.), whether by nature or by 
heritage. He acts as if he had 2 points of Armor when hit by 
damage-causing arcane powers, and adds +2 to his Trait rolls 
when resisting opposed powers. Even friendly arcane powers 
must subtract this modifier to affect the resistant hero. 

Improved Arcane Resistance

Requirements: Novice, Arcane Resistance 

As above but Armor and resistance are increased to 4. 

Attractive 

Requirements: Novice, Vigor d6+ 

It’s no secret that beautiful people have an easier time 
getting their way in life. This Edge grants your beautiful or 
handsome character +2 to Charisma. 

Very Attractive

Requirements: Novice, Attractive 

Your hero is drop-dead gorgeous. His Charisma is 
increased to +4. 

Berserk 

Requirements: Novice 

Immediately after suffering a wound (including a Shaken 
result from physical damage), your hero must make a Smarts 
roll or go Berserk. 

While Berserk, his Parry is reduced by 2 but he adds +2 to all 
Fighting, Strength, melee damage rolls, and Toughness. The 
warrior ignores all wound modifiers while Berserk, but cannot 
use any skills, Edges, or maneuvers that require concentration, 
including Shooting and Taunt, but not Intimidation. 

Berserkers attack with reckless abandon. Anytime his 
Fighting die is a 1 (regardless of his Wild Die), he hits a random 
adjacent target (not the original target). The attack may hit 
friend as well as foe. If there are no other adjacent targets, 
the blow simply misses. 

The Berserker may end his rage by doing nothing (not even 
moving) for one full action and making a Smarts roll at –2. 

Brave 

Requirements: Novice, Spirit d6+ 

Those with this Edge have learned to master their fear. Or 
perhaps are so jaded or emotionally distant they’ve just lost 
their normal “fight or flight” responses. Either way, your hero 
adds +2 to Fear tests. If the character is in a setting that uses 
Guts as a Setting Rule, it adds to that as well. 

Brawny

Requirements: Novice, Strength and Vigor d6+ 

Your bruiser is very large or perhaps just very fit. His 
bulk resists damage better than most and adds +1 to his 

32 

Toughness. In addition, the character can carry more than 
most proportional to his Strength. He can carry 8 times his 
Strength in pounds without penalty instead of the usual 5 
times his Strength. 

Fast Healer 

Requirements: Novice, Vigor d8+ 

Some individuals just seem to heal faster than others. Those 
with this blessing add +2 to Vigor rolls when checking for 
natural healing. See page 78 for complete rules on Healing. 

Fleet-Footed 

Requirements: Novice, Agility d6+ 
The hero’s Pace is increased by +2 and he rolls a d10 
instead of a d6 when running. 

Linguist

Requirements: Novice, Smarts d6+ 

The character has an ear for languages and a rare talent 
for recognizing similarities between them. A character with 
this Edge starts with a number of languages equal to his 
Smarts die, and can make a Smarts roll at –2 to make herself 
understood in any language or dialect she has heard spoken 
for at least a week. 

Luck 

Requirements: Novice 

The adventurer seems to be blessed by fate, karma, the gods, 
or whatever external forces he believes in (or believe in him!) 

He draws one extra Benny at the beginning of each game 
session, allowing him to succeed at important tasks more 
often than most, and survive incredible dangers. 

Great Luck 

Requirements: Novice, Luck 

The player draws two extra Bennies instead of one at 
the start of each session. 

Noble 

Requirements: Novice 

Those born of noble blood have many perks in life, but often 
have just as many responsibilities. Nobles have high status 
in their societies, are entitled to special treatment from their 
foes, gain +2 Charisma, and also have the Rich Edge. This 
gives the hero several Edges for the price of one, but the 
responsibilities more than offset the additional perks. Nobles 
often have troops under their control, as well as land, a family 
home, and other assets. All of this must be determined by the 
GM, and balanced by the grave responsibilities the character 
faces. 

As an example, a character in a fantasy campaign might 
have a company of swordsmen, a small keep, and even a 
magical sword he inherited from his father. But he also has 
an entire region to manage, criminals to judge, justice to 
mete out, and a jealous neighbor who covets his lands and 
constantly plots against him at court. 

33 

Quick 

Requirements: Novice, Agility d8+ 

Quick characters have lightning-fast reflexes and a cool 
head. Whenever you are dealt a 5 or lower in combat, you 
may discard and draw again until you get a card higher than 5. 

Characters with both the Level Headed and Quick Edges 
draw their additional card and take the best as usual. If that 
card is a Five or less, the Quick Edge may be used to draw 
a replacement until it’s Six or higher. 

Rich 

Requirements: Novice 

Whether the individual was born with a silver spoon in his 
mouth or earned it through hard work, he’s got more money 
than most. Rich heroes start with three times the normal 
starting funds for the setting. If a regular income is appropriate 
for this setting, the hero receives the modern day equivalent 
of a $150,000 annual salary. 

Filthy Rich

Requirements: Novice, Rich or Noble 

This character is very wealthy. He has five times the 
starting funds for the setting and, if appropriate, a yearly 
income of around $500,000. 

Wealthier characters should have a very complete 
background as well. This needs to be worked out with 
the GM, and comes with many more assets as well as 
onerous responsibilities. 

Combat Edges 

These Edges are designed to help your hero dish out terrible 
damage—or survive it—in the bloody battles of Savage 
Worlds. 

Block 

Requirements: Seasoned, Fighting d8+ 

Warriors who engage in frequent hand-to-hand combat 
are far more skilled in personal defense than most others. 

34 

They’ve learned not only how to attack, but how to block 
their opponent’s blows as well. A fighter with this Edge adds 
+1 to his Parry. 

Improved Block

Requirements: Veteran, Block 

As above, but the hero adds +2 to his Parry. 

Brawler 

Requirements: Novice, Str d8+ 

Frequent fights with his bare hands have given this thug 
a powerful punch. When he hits a foe with a successful 
bare-handed Fighting roll, he adds +2 to his damage. 

Bruiser 

Requirements: Seasoned, Brawler 

When the bruiser gets a raise on his bare-handed 
Fighting attack, he rolls a d8 instead of a d6. 

Combat Reflexes 

Requirements: Seasoned 

Your adventurer recovers quickly from shock and trauma. 
He adds +2 to his Spirit roll when attempting to recover from 
being Shaken. 

Counterattack 

Requirements: Seasoned, Fighting d8+ 

Fighters with this Edge know how to respond instantly to 
an enemy’s mistakes. Once per round (if not Shaken), the 
character receives one free Fighting attack against one 
adjacent foe who failed a Fighting attack against him. This 
attack is made at –2, and the Counterattack must be a normal 
attack (no Disarm, Wild Attack, or other maneuvers), and may 
not be combined with Frenzy or Sweep. It may be used with 
the Defend maneuver, but not Full Defense. 

Improved Counterattack

Requirements: Veteran, Counterattack 

As above but the character may ignore the –2 penalty. 

Dodge

Requirements: Seasoned, Agility d8+ 

Some crafty types know how to get out of harm’s way. This 
Edge allows them to use cover, movement, and concealment 
to make them harder to hit. Unless they are the victim of a 
surprise attack and taken completely unaware, attackers must 
subtract 1 from their ranged attack rolls when targeting them 
(even in close combat). 

Characters who attempt to evade area effect attacks may 
add +1 to their Agility roll as well (when allowed). 

Improved Dodge

Requirements: Veteran, Dodge 

As above but attackers subtract 2 from their attack rolls, 
and the character adds +2 to evade area effect weapons 
when allowed. 

Elan 

Requirements: Novice, Spirit d8+ 

When this spirited hero puts his heart into something it tends 
to pay off in big ways. When you spend a Benny on a Trait 
roll (including Soak rolls), add +2 to the final total. 

Extraction 

Requirements: Novice, Agility d8+ 

When a character normally withdraws from a melee, 
his attacker gets a free attack before he does so—a very 
dangerous proposition for most. Your hero is adept at retreating 
from an engagement. 

Make an Agility roll. If successful, one opponent doesn’t get 
a free attack anytime you disengage (see page 76). 

Improved Extraction

Requirements: Novice, Extraction 

As above but if you succeed with a raise all opponents 
currently in melee with the character lose their free attack 
as your warrior withdraws. 

First Strike 

Requirements: Novice, Agility d8+ 

Once per turn the hero (if not Shaken) gets a free Fighting 
attack against a single foe who moves adjacent to him. This 
automatically interrupts the opponent’s action and does not 
cost the hero his action if he is on Hold or has not yet acted 
this round. 

Improved First Strike

Requirements: Heroic, First Strike 

As above but the hero may make one free attack 
against each and every foe who moves adjacent to him. 

Florentine 

Requirements: Novice, Agility d8+, Fighting d8+ 

A character trained to fight “Florentine” is a master at 
wielding two weapons at once. He adds +1 to his Fighting 
rolls versus an opponent with a single weapon and no shield. 
In addition, opponents subtract 1 from any “gang up” bonuses 
they would normally get against the fighter as his two flashing 
blades parry their blows. 

Frenzy

Requirements: Seasoned, Fighting d10+ 

Frenzied fighters make fast and furious melee attacks, 
sacrificing finesse for raw speed. This allows them to make an 
extra Fighting attack per round at a –2 penalty to all Fighting 
rolls. This attack must be taken at the same time as another 
Fighting attack though it may target any two foes adjacent to 
the hero (Wild Cards roll two Fighting dice and one Wild Die). 
The –2 penalty is subtracted from all attacks. 

A character armed with two weapons still only makes one 
extra attack. 

Improved Frenzy

Requirements: Veteran, Frenzy 

As above but the character may ignore the –2 Frenzy 
penalty. 

Giant Killer 

Requirements: Veteran 

The bigger they are, the harder they are to kill. At least for 
most. But your hero knows how to find the weak points in 
massive creatures. 

Your hero does +1d6 damage when attacking creatures 
three sizes or more larger than himself. An ogre (Size +3) 

35 

with this ability, for example, gains the bonus only against 
creatures of Size +6 or greater. A human Giant Killer (Size 0), 
can claim the bonus against the ogre, however. 

Hard to Kill 

Requirements: Wild Card, Novice, Spirit d8+ 

This adventurer has more lives than a truckload of cats. 
When forced to make Vigor rolls due to Incapacitation, he may 
ignore his wound modifiers. This only applies to Vigor rolls 
called for to resist Incapacitation or death (see page 68). He 
still suffers from wound modifiers for other Trait rolls normally. 

Harder to Kill 

Requirements: Veteran, Hard to Kill 

Your hero is tougher to kill than Rasputin. If he is ever 
“killed,” roll a die. On an odd result, he’s dead as usual. 
On an even roll, he’s Incapacitated but somehow escapes 
death. He may be captured, stripped of all his belongings, 
or mistakenly left for dead, but he somehow survives. 

Improvisational Fighter

Requirements: Seasoned, Smarts d6+ 

Heroes often find themselves fighting with pieces of 
equipment or furnishings not designed for combat. A 
character with this Edge has a knack for using such 
improvised weapons, and does not suffer the usual –1 
penalty to attack and Parry when wielding them. See 
page 73 for details. 

Killer Instinct 

Requirements: Heroic 

This hero hates losing. If he ties on an opposed roll of any 
sort, he wins. In addition, if his skill die on an opposed skill 
roll is a 1, he can reroll it (but must keep the second result, 
even if it’s another 1). 

Level Headed 

Requirements: Seasoned, Smarts d8+ 

Fighters who can keep their cool when everyone else is 
running for cover are deadly customers in combat. 

A hero with this Edge draws an additional Action Card in 
combat and acts on the best of the draw. 

Improved Level Headed

Requirements: Seasoned, Level Headed 

As above but the hero draws 3 cards. 

Marksman 

Requirements: Seasoned 

The hero excels at taking controlled, measured shots. If he 
does not move in a turn, he may fire as if he took the Aim 
maneuver. Marksman may never be used with a Rate of Fire 
greater than 1. 

Marksman works with both Shooting and Throwing. 

Martial Artist 

Requirements: Novice, Fighting d6+ 

This character is highly trained in hand-to-hand fighting. 
He is never considered unarmed in combat and so is never 
subject to the Unarmed Defender rule (page 76). With a 
successful unarmed attack, he adds +d4 to his Strength roll 
(as if he were using a small weapon). 

Improved Martial Artist

Requirements: Veteran, Martial Arts, Fighting d10+ 

The character now adds +d6 to his bare-handed 
damage. 

Nerves of Steel 

Requirements: Wild Card, Novice, Vigor d8+ 

Your hero has learned to fight on through the most intense 
pain. He may ignore 1 point of wound penalties. 

Improved Nerves of Steel

Requirements: Novice, Nerves of Steel 

The hero ignores 2 points of wound penalties. 

No Mercy

Requirements: Seasoned 

The character may spend a Benny to reroll any one damage 
roll, including those made for area effect attacks. 

Quick Draw 

Requirements: Novice, Agility d8+ 

This Edge allows a hero to draw a weapon as a free action 
(and thus ignore the usual –2 multi-action penalty if he 
chooses to fire as well). If the character must make an Agility 
roll to draw a weapon (see page 66), he adds +2 to the roll. 

Rock and Roll! 

Requirements: Seasoned, Shooting d8+ 

Some veteran shooters learn to compensate for the recoil 
of fully automatic weapons. If a character with this Edge does 
not move, he may ignore the recoil penalty for firing a weapon 
on full automatic. 

Steady Hands

Requirements: Novice, Agility d8+ 

Your hero ignores the “unstable platform” penalty for firing 
from the backs of animals or while riding in moving vehicles. 
In addition, when performing actions while Running (see page 
65), his penalty is –1 instead of –2. 

Sweep

Requirements: Novice, Strength d8+, Fighting d8+ 

Sweep allows a character to make a single Fighting attack 
and apply it against all currently adjacent targets at a –2 
penalty (friends and foes alike—be careful). Resolve each 
damage roll separately. The attack is applied immediately 
when rolled and only affects targets adjacent at that time. 

A character may not use Sweep in the same round she 
uses Frenzy, nor may she Sweep more than once per round, 
or with a second weapon held in another hand. In effect, the 
hero may only perform Sweep once per action unless she 
somehow gets two entire actions (perhaps under the effects 
of a spell or power, for example). 

Improved Sweep

Requirements: Veteran, Sweep 

As above but the hero may ignore the –2 penalty. 

Trademark Weapon

Requirements: Novice, Fighting or Shooting of d10+ 

The hero knows one unique weapon (Excalibur, Old Betsy, 
Sting) like the back of his hand. When using that weapon, he 

36 

adds +1 to his Fighting, Shooting, or Throwing rolls. A hero 
can take this Edge multiple times, applying it to a different 
weapon each time. If a Trademark Weapon is lost, the hero 
can replace it, but the benefit of the Edge doesn’t kick in for 
two game weeks. 

Improved Trademark Weapon

Requirements: Veteran, Trademark Weapon 

As above but the bonus when using the weapon 
increases to +2. 

Two-Fisted 

Requirements: Novice, Agility d8+ 

ATwo-Fisted hero isn’t ambidextrous—he’s simply learned to 
fight with two weapons (or both fists) at once. When attacking 
with a weapon in each hand, he rolls each attack separately 
but ignores the multi-action penalty (see page 66). 

Leadership Edges 

Leadership Edges grant bonuses to subordinates, making 
them more effective, reliable, or durable. These Edges apply 
only to a number of subordinates within 5” (the “command 
radius”), and are not cumulative with the same Edge from 
other leaders. Subordinates may benefit from different 
Leadership Edges by the same or different leaders. 

Command 

Requirements: Novice, Smarts d6+ 

Command is the ability to give clear instructions to 
surrounding allies and enforce your hero’s will upon them. 
This makes your character’s compatriots more willing to fight 
on despite their wounds, and so adds +1 to their Spirit rolls 
to recover from being Shaken. 

Command Presence 

Requirements: Novice, Command 

A booming voice, effective commands, natural charisma, 
or simple training results in a much more effective combat 
element. At the center of that element is the officer in 
command. A hero with this Edge has a “command radius” of 
10” instead of the usual 5”. 

Fervor 

Requirements: Veteran, Command, Spirit d8+ 

A simple phrase uttered by a great leader can sometimes 
have momentous results. A leader with this ability can inspire 
his men to bloody fervor by yelling a motto, slogan, or other 
inspirational words. Those in the command radius add +1 to 
their Fighting damage rolls. 

Hold the Line! 

Requirements: Seasoned, Command, Smarts d8+ 

This Edge strengthens the will of the men under the hero’s 
command. The troops add +1 to their Toughness. 

Inspire

Requirements: Seasoned, Command 

Leaders with exceptional reputations and experience in 
battle inspire the soldiers around them. They add +2 to Spirit 
rolls when recovering from being Shaken (this includes the 
original +1 bonus for the Command Edge). 

Leader of Men 

Requirements: Veteran, Command 

Command comes easy to this commander. Those under his 
command work like a well-oiled machine when he’s in charge. 

Allies under the leader’s command roll a d10 as the Wild 
Die instead of a d6 when making group rolls. 

37 

Natural Leader 

Requirements: Novice, Command, Spirit d8+ 

This Edge signifies a special link between a leader and his 
men. With it, he may share his Bennies with any troops under 
his command. 

Tactician 

Requirements: Seasoned, Command, Wild Card, 
Smarts d8+, Knowledge (Battle) d6+ 

The leader has a natural grasp of small unit tactics and can 
frequently take advantage of a rapidly changing situation. 

At the beginning of a fight and before any Action Cards are 
dealt, the hero makes a Knowledge (Battle) roll. For each 
success and raise he receives one Action Card. These are 
kept separate from his regular Action Cards and are not placed 
back into the deck until used or the combat ends (including 
Jokers!). At the start of any round, the hero may give one or 
more of these extra cards to his allies, whether Extras or Wild 
Cards, who then use it as their Action Card for the round in 
place of the one dealt them. This allows Extras to operate 
independently of Wild Card characters for one round if they 
receive their own card. 

Only one character per encounter may use this Edge. 

Power Edges 

Power Edges are for those with Arcane Backgrounds. See 
Chapter Five for more information on each type of Arcane 
Background, how to use them, and the powers available. 

New Power 

Requirements: Novice, Arcane Background 

An arcane character may learn a new power by choosing this 
Edge (which may be taken multiple times). He may choose 
from any powers normally available to his particular Arcane 
Background. 

Power Points 

Requirements: Novice, Arcane Background 

Wizards, weird scientists, and other arcane types always 
want more power. This Edge grants them an additional 5 
Power Points. 

Power Points may be selected more than once, but only 
once per Rank. 

Rapid Recharge

Requirements: Seasoned, Spirit d6+, Arcane 
Background 

This Edge allows an arcane character to regain 1 Power 
Point every 30 minutes. 

Improved Rapid Recharge

Requirements: Veteran, Rapid Recharge 

The character regains 1 Power Point every 15 minutes. 

Soul Drain 

Rank: Seasoned, Arcane Background (any but Weird 
Science), Knowledge (Arcana) d10+ 

Spellcasters, mentalists, and other arcane types in dire need 
of Power Points may use this Edge to drain energy from their 
own souls. To use this dangerous ability, the arcane character 

first decides how many Power Points he wants to draw from 
himself. Then he makes a Spirit roll minus the number of points 
he’s trying to drain. (This is a free action.) On a Spirit total of 
1 or less, the character suffers a wound and falls unconscious 
for 1d6 hours. On a failure, the character suffers a wound. On 
a success or better, the character gets the points he needed 
and may attempt to cast a spell with them immediately (they 
may not be saved). 

Professional Edges 

Professional Edges are very special abilities that reflect 
many years of practicing a particular trade. In some cases 
they may also represent special blessings from higher powers 
as well. 

These Edges help you create a character who is far more 
competent in his chosen field than most others. If you want to 
make a very effective Mad Scientist, for example, you could 
combine the Arcane Background (Weird Science) with the 
Gadgeteer and Mr. Fix It Edges. 

Professional Edges represent many years of training so 
their Requirements are quite high. Players may purchase 
Professional Edges after character creation, but should 
usually lead up to it story-wise by practicing the affected trade 
during down-time or in between adventures. The time spent 
acquiring one of these abilities is subjective and up to the 
Game Master, but makes the game much more believable if 
a little narrative time is spent training. 

. 
Stacking: 
Bonuses to the same Trait from different 
Professional Edges do not stack. If you make a hero with both 
the Woodsman and the Thief Edges, for example, he gains 
+2 to his Stealth skill, not +4. 
Ace 

Requirements: Novice, Agility d8+ 

Aces are special pilots and drivers who feel more 
comfortable behind the wheel, throttle, or flight stick than on 
their own two feet. 

Aces add +2 to Boating, Driving, and Piloting rolls. In 
addition, they may also spend Bennies to make Soak rolls for 
any vehicle or vessel they control. This is a Boating, Driving, 
or Piloting roll at –2 (cancelling their usual +2). Each success 
and raise negates a wound and any critical hit that would 
have resulted from it. 

Acrobat 

Requirements: Novice, Agility d8+, Strength d6+ 

Those who have formal training in the acrobatic arts or are 
naturally agile may take this Edge. It adds +2 to all Agility 
rolls made to perform acrobatic maneuvers (including Trick 
maneuvers), and also adds +1 to a character’s Parry as long 
as he has no encumbrance penalty. 

Adept

Requirements: Novice, Arcane Background (Miracles), 
Martial Artist, Faith d8+, Fighting d8+ 

Adepts are holy warriors who have trained themselves to be 
living weapons. Some do so to be ultimate warriors; others 
do it in the service of a cause or deity. 

38 

As a free action, an adept can spend 1 Power Point to gain 
AP 2 with all of his unarmed attacks until his next action. 

In addition, upon taking this Edge and at each new Rank, 
they may choose to change the trappings of one of the 
following powers to work only on themselves but be activated 
as a free action: boost/lower trait, deflection, healing, smite, or 
speed. The Adept must have the power to begin with, and this 
does not allow him to activate more than one power in a round. 

Assassin 

Requirements: Novice, Agility d8+, Climbing d6+, 
Fighting d6+, Stealth d8+ 

Assassins are trained killers who know how to kill with deadly 
precision — if they can properly approach their prey. Assassins 
add +2 to any damage roll where they strike a foe unawares 
(even with ranged attacks). 

Champion

Requirements: Novice, Arcane Background (Miracles), 
Spirit d8+, Strength d6+, Vigor d8+, Faith d6+, Fighting 
d8+ 

Champions are holy (or unholy) men and women chosen 
to fight for a particular deity or religion. Most are pious souls 
ready and willing to lay down their lives for a greater cause, 
but some may have been born into the role and follow their 
path with some reluctance. 

Champions fight the forces of 
darkness (or good). They add 
+2 damage when attacking 
supernaturally evil (or good) creatures, 
and have +2 Toughness when 
suffering damage from 
supernaturally evil (or 
good) sources, including 
arcane powers and the 
weapons, claws, teeth, 
etc., of such creatures. 

Gadgeteer

Requirements: 

Novice, Arcane 
Background (Weird 
Science), Smarts d8+, 
Repair d8+, Weird Science d8+, at 
least two other scientific Knowledge 
skills at d6+ 

These mechanical gurus are 

so technically savvy they can 

quickly build a machine to 
handle nearly any situation. 

Once per game session, a 
gadgeteer can create a “juryrigged” 
device from spare parts. 
The device functions just like any 
other Weird Science device, and uses 
any power available to Weird Scientists in that 
setting (though this is still subject to Rank restrictions). It 
has half the inventor’s Power Points, and once these are used 
up, the gadget burns out and does not recharge. The inventor 
must have access to some parts and a reasonable amount of 

time (GM’s call, but at least 1d20 minutes) to create the gizmo. 

Holy/Unholy Warrior

Requirements: Novice, Arcane Background (Miracles), 
Spirit d8+, Faith d6+ 

Acolytes, clerics, paladins, holy slayers, and other avatars of 
the gods are frequently tasked with battling the forces of evil 
in the mortal world. This Edge gives them a slight advantage 
against such foes. 

As an action, a priest or other holy person may call upon 
his chosen deity to repulse supernaturally evil creatures, 
such as the undead, demons, and the like. It also works on 
evil characters with the Arcane Background (Miracles) Edge. 

Repulsing evil costs 1 Power Point and has a range of the 
character’s Spirit. Targeted creatures within that range must 
make a Spirit roll. Failure means the creature is Shaken; a 1 
means it is destroyed. Wild Cards suffer an automatic Wound 
instead. 

A character may also be an Unholy Warrior working for 
the forces of evil. In this case, he repulses good creatures, 
such as angels, paladins, or good characters with 

Arcane Background (Miracles). 

Investigator

Requirements: Novice, 

Smarts d8+, Investigation d8+, 

Streetwise d8+ 

Investigators have spent a great 

deal of time researching ancient 

legends, working the streets, or 

deducing devilish mysteries. 

Some of these heroes are 

actual Private Investigators 

for hire while others may 

be sleuthing mages in a 

fantasy world or perhaps inquisitive 

college professors stumbling upon Things 

Man Was Not Meant to Know in the 

dark of night. Investigators add +2 to 

Investigation and Streetwise rolls, 

as well as Notice rolls made to 

search through evidence. 

Jack-of-All-Trades 

Requirements: Novice, 

Smarts d10+ 

Through advanced schooling, 

book-learning, computer-

enhanced skill programs, or just 

amazing intuitive perception, your hero 

has a talent for picking up skills on the fly. There is 

little he can’t figure out given a little time and a 

dash of luck. 

Any time he makes an unskilled roll for a 

Smarts-based skill, he may do so at d4 instead 

of the usual d4–2. 

39 

McGyver

Requirements: Novice, Smarts d6+, Repair d6+, 
Notice d8+ 

This character can improvise something when the need for 
a tool arises. He suffers no negative penalties on Trait rolls 
for lack of equipment in most situations. 

In addition, given a few simple tools, props, or devices, he 
can generally rig devices to help escape from death-traps, 
weapons to match some bizarre need, or otherwise create 
something that’s needed when such a thing isn’t actually 
present. The extent of this is completely up to the Game 
Master, but creativity should be rewarded, particularly in dire 
situations where few other answers are possible. 

Mentalist 

Requirements: Novice, Arcane Background (Psionics), 
Smarts d8+, Psionics d6+ 

Mentalists are masters of mind control and psionics. Some 
are pulp heroes, others are trained in secret government 
academies to root out traitors. Their frequent toying with 
human minds gives them a +2 on any opposed Psionics roll, 
whether they are using their powers against a foe or are trying 
to defend against a rival Mentalist. 

Mr. Fix it 

Requirements: Novice, Arcane Background (Weird 
Science), Smarts d10+, Repair d8+, Weird Science d8+, 
at least two other scientific Knowledge skills at d6+ 

The inventor adds +2 to Repair rolls. With a raise, he halves 
the time normally required to fix something. This means that 
if a particular Repair job already states that a raise repairs it 
in half the time, a Mr. Fix It could finish the job in one-quarter 
the time with a raise. 

Scholar 

Requirements: Novice, d8+ in affected skill 

Learned professors, devoted students, and amateur 
enthusiasts spend months of their lives studying particular 
subjects. They become experts in these fields, and rarely 
fail to answer questions in their particular area of expertise. 

Pick any two Knowledge skills the Scholar has a d8 or 
better in. Add +2 to your total whenever these skills are used. 
Those who study military history have a natural edge when 
commanding troops in Mass Battles (see page 92)—a +2 to 
a Knowledge (Battle) roll can mean the difference between 
a rousing victory and a crushing defeat. 

Thief 

Requirements: Novice, Agility d8+, Climbing d6+, 
Lockpicking d6+, Stealth d8+ 

Thieves specialize in deceit, treachery, and acrobatics. They 
can be invaluable where traps must be detected, walls must 
be climbed, and locks must be picked. 

Thieves add +2 to Climbing, Lockpick, Stealth, as well as 
Notice or Repair rolls that relate to traps and similar devices. 
The bonus to Stealth does not apply when the character is in 
a wilderness environment—only in urban areas. 

Wizard 

Requirements: Novice, Arcane Background (Magic), 
Smarts d8+, Knowledge (Arcana) d8+, Spellcasting d6+ 

Wizards range from young apprentices to frighteningly 
powerful supreme sorcerers. They are often physically weak, 
however, and rarely have the divine powers or healing abilities 
of priestly spellcasters. What they lack in spiritual favor, 
however, they more than make up for in utility and eldritch 
might. 

Wizards tend to learn their craft in formalized institutions 
or under the tutelage of experienced masters. Each raise a 
Wizard gets on his Spellcasting roll reduces the cost of the 
spell by 1 Power Point. The Wizard must have the points 
available to cast the spell in the first place before rolling. 

Woodsman 

Requirements: Novice, Spirit d6+, Survival d8+, 
Tracking d8+ 

Woodsmen are rangers, scouts, and hunters who are more 
at home in the wilderness than in urban areas. They are skilled 
trackers and scouts, and know how to live off the land for 
months at a time. Woodsmen gain +2 to Tracking, Survival, 
and Stealth rolls made in the wilderness (not towns, ruins, or 
underground). 

40 

Social Edges 


Getting people to do what you want is a critical skill in most 
any setting. These Edges help your hero do just that. 

Charismatic 

Requirements: Novice, Spirit d8+ 

Your hero has learned how to work with others, even those 
who might be somewhat opposed to him or his efforts. This 
adds +2 to his Charisma. 

Common Bond 

Requirements: Wild Card, Novice, Spirit d8+ 

This Edge signifies a special link between close companions— 
such as a typical party. It doesn’t matter whether or not the 
characters get along perfectly or not, they’ve just formed a 
close and common bond during their epic adventures. 

A character with this Edge may freely give his Bennies to any 
other Wild Card he can communicate with. This represents 
the character giving his verbal or spiritual support to the ally. 
The player should say what his character is doing to give 
the support. The gesture could be as complex as a rousing 
speech, or as simple as a knowing nod. 

Connections 

Requirements: Novice 

Whether it’s to the Feds, the cops, the Mob, or some big 
corporation, your heroine knows someone on the inside— 
someone who is willing to lend her a hand on occasion (usually 
once per game session). 

This Edge may be taken more than once, but each time 
must be applied to a different organization. The GM should 
also ensure the organization is limited to a single, unique 
organization. A hero may, for instance, have Connections (US 
Army), but he shouldn’t have a blanket Connections (Military). 

To use a character’s Connections requires that she first get 
in touch with one of her contacts. This requires a Streetwise 
roll. Failure means the particular contact wasn’t available, 
their cell phone wasn’t on, or they were otherwise tied up. 

Once in contact, the hero must make a Persuasion roll. The 
GM should feel free to modify both the Persuasion roll and 
any results based on the circumstances. 

A failure indicates the heroine’s contacts just couldn’t come 
through this time, or perhaps just weren’t persuaded that their 
help was really necessary. 

On a success, the contact might share information, but 
won’t do anything too risky to help. On a raise, the contact is 
willing to leak sensitive information, but stops short of outright 
betrayal. 

Two or more raises means the heroine has pushed the right 
buttons and can count on serious help. The Connection will 
risk serious consequences for the heroine, and if she needs 
financial assistance, may provide more than he’s comfortable 
with. If the heroine asks for muscle, the contact delivers 
either one expert (a safe-cracker, wheel-man, security expert, 
etc.) or five average fighter-types for the contact’s particular 
organization (a mob boss sends five thugs, the Army sends 
five infantrymen, etc.). 

Strong Willed

Requirements: Novice, Intimidation d6+, Taunt d6+ 

Characters with strong willpower use their voice, steely 
stares, or quick wits to unnerve their opponents. Strong Willed 
adds +2 to a character’s Intimidation and Taunt rolls, as well as 
his Spirit and Smarts rolls when resisting Test of Wills attacks. 

Weird Edges 

Weird Edges are slightly supernatural and only appropriate 
in games with those elements. 

Beast Bond 

Requirements: Novice 

Some individuals can exert incredible will over their animal 
companions. These characters may spend their own Bennies 
for any animals under their control, including mounts, pet 
dogs, familiars, and so on. 

Beast Master 

Requirements: Novice, Spirit d8+ 

Animals like your hero, and won’t attack him unless he 
attacks them first or they are enraged for some reason. His 
“animal magnetism” is so great he’s attracted a loyal animal 
of some sort as well. This is typically a dog, wolf, or raptor, 
though the GM may allow other companions if it fits the setting. 

The beast is an Extra (not a Wild Card). If it should be killed, 
the hero finds a replacement in 2d6 days. 

Danger Sense

Requirements: Novice 

Your hero can sense when something bad is about to 
happen. Anytime he’s about to be the victim of a surprise 
attack, ambush, or other nasty surprise, he gets a Notice roll 
at –2 just before the attack or event occurs. If successful, 
the character knows something is about to happen and may 
take appropriate action against it. This means the hero is on 
Hold for the first round of a combat. Should the hero fail his 
roll, he still follows the normal Surprise rules, if applicable 
(see page 65). 

Healer 

Requirements: Novice, Spirit d8+ 

A hero with this Edge adds +2 to all Healing rolls (including 
natural healing rolls for his own wounds), whether natural 
or magical in nature. Up to five companions traveling with a 
Healer add the bonus to their natural healing rolls as well. 

Liquid Courage

Requirements: Novice, Vigor d8+ 

Your hero processes alcohol far differently than most. The 
round after consuming a stiff drink (at least 8 ounces of hard 
liquor or equivalent), the character’s Vigor increases by one 
die type (increasing Toughness as well). The hard drinker can 
also ignore one level of wound modifiers (which stacks with 
other abilities that do the same). 

The effect lasts for one hour after it begins. If the drunkard 
seeks inebriation he suffers –2 to Smarts and Agility-based 
rolls for as long as he continues to drink and the next 1d6 
hours thereafter. 

41 

Scavenger

Requirements: Novice, Luck 

Once per session the hero may “suddenly remember” that 
he has a much-needed piece of equipment on his person. The 
item must be capable of being stored in the hero’s pocket or 
bag (assuming he has one), and the Game Master has the 
final word on what can be found. 

Wild Card Edges 

The following Edges work only when the character is dealt 
a Joker during combat. The Edge’s effects are in addition to 
the usual effects of being dealt a Joker. 

Dead Shot 

Requirements: Wild Card, Seasoned, Shooting/ 
Throwing d10+ 

The character doubles his total damage when making a 
successful Shooting or Throwing attack this round. 

Mighty Blow

Requirements: Wild Card, Seasoned, Fighting d10+ 

The character doubles his total damage when making a 
successful Fighting attack this round. 

Power Surge

Requirements: Wild Card, Seasoned, arcane skill d10+ 

This Edge is for those characters with Arcane Backgrounds. 
When dealt a Joker, the character recovers 2d6 Power Points. 
He may not exceed his usual limit. 

Legendary Edges 

Most Legendary Edges are very specific to their campaign 
world—such as gaining a stronghold or divine favor—but a 
few fit most anywhere, as shown below. 

Followers 

Requirements: Wild Card, Legendary 

Heroes often acquire dedicated warbands, “merry men,” 
or others who voluntarily follow the hero on his adventures. 

Each time this Edge is chosen, five followers join the hero’s 
band. Casualties are not automatically replaced, so a hero 
may need to choose this Edge again on occasion to replenish 
his losses. The followers must have some way to eat and 
earn income, and generally want a piece of whatever loot, 
treasure, or other rewards the hero acquires. Otherwise, they 
are completely dedicated to their idol and risk their lives for 
him under any normal conditions. They won’t knowingly throw 
their lives away except under very special circumstances. 

The GM determines the followers’ statistics, but in general, 
use the Soldier statistics presented on page 81. Followers 
generally come with only basic equipment depending on 
their particular setting (warriors in fantasy come with at least 
leather armor and short swords, for example). The hero must 
purchase any additional equipment for his Followers himself. 

Martial Arts Master 

Requirements: Legendary, Improved Martial Arts, 
Fighting d12+ 

The warrior is deadly with his hands. He adds +2 to his 
bare-handed damage every time he takes this Edge, up to 
a maximum of five times for a total damage bonus of +10. 

Professional 

Requirements: Legendary, d12 in affected Trait 

The character is an expert at a particular skill or attribute 
(his choice). That Trait becomes d12+1. This Edge may be 
selected more than once, but it may never be applied to the 
same skill or attribute twice. 

Expert

Requirements: Legendary, Professional in affected Trait 

As above, but the Trait increases to d12+2. 

Master 

Requirements: Wild Card, Legendary, Expert in 
affected Trait 

The character’s Wild Die increases to a d10 when 
rolling a particular Trait of his choice. This Edge may be 
chosen multiple times, though it only affects a particular 
Trait once. 

Sidekick 

Requirements: Wild Card, Legendary 

A character who triumphs over evil time and time again 
becomes an inspiration to others. Eventually, one of these 
young crusaders may attempt to join the hero in his epic 
quests. 

The hero gains a Novice Rank sidekick. The sidekick is a 
Wild Card, gains experience as usual, and has abilities that 
complement or mimic his hero’s. 

The player character should control his sidekick just like any 
other ally. Of course, the sidekick may occasionally cause 
trouble (by getting captured, running into danger when he’s 
not supposed to, etc.). The player should be prepared for his 
“Edge” to occasionally become a “Hindrance.” 

If the sidekick dies, he isn’t replaced unless the hero chooses 
this Edge again. 

Tough as Nails

Requirements: Legendary 

Your hero is a grizzled veteran. Increase his Toughness 
by +1. 

Improved Tough as Nails

Requirements: Legendary, Tough as Nails 

Increase your hero’s Toughness by another +1. 

Weapon Master

Requirements: Legendary, Fighting d12 

Increase your hero’s Parry by +1. 

Master of Arms 

Requirements: Legendary, Weapon Master 

Increase your hero’s Parry by another +1. 

42 

Advancement 
Legendary Characters 


At the end of each game session (usually 4-6 hours of 
gaming), the GM awards 1 to 3 Experience Points to everyone 
in the group, based on these guidelines. 

Experience Awards 

Award Situation 

1 The group accomplished little or had a very short 

session. 

2 The group had more successes than failures. 

3 The group succeeded greatly, and their adventure 

had a significant impact on the overall story. 

Ranks 

As a character gains more Experience Points, he goes up 
in “Rank.” This is a rough measure of how powerful the hero 
is. As characters progress in experience, new Ranks allow 
access to more powerful Edges. 

Rank Table 
Experience Points Rank 

0-19 
Novice 

20-39 
Seasoned 

40-59 
Veteran 

60-79 
Heroic 

80+ 
Legendary 

Every 5 points accumulated grants a hero an Advance. An 
Advance lets a character do one of the following: 

• Gain a new Edge. 
• 
Increase a skill that is equal to or greater than its linked 
attribute by one die type. 
• 
Increase two skills that are lower than their linked 
attributes by one die type each. 
• Buy a new skill at d4. 
• Increase one attribute by a die type.* 
*You may only choose this option once per Rank. 
No Trait may be raised above a d12 (but see 

the Professional and Expert Legendary Edges). 

Legendary characters may raise an attribute every 

other Advance. 

Starting With Experienced Characters

If the GM lets you make a character who has already earned 
some experience, simply make a character as usual and 
then grant her that many Advances. A Veteran character, for 
example, has 40 Experience Points, so you would make a 
normal character and grant her eight Advances. 

Additional goods, equipment, or other assets must be 
determined by the Game Master and the particular setting. 
As a quick rule of thumb, a character’s starting funds double 
with each Rank after Novice. 

. 
Replacement Characters: When a character dies, his 
new hero begins play with one less Advance than his last. 
Legendary characters are major forces in their worlds, and 
often have political power and influence as well as a host of 
Edges to defeat those who oppose them. 

Once a hero reaches Legendary status, the rules for 
Advances change a bit. The character now Advances every 
time he accumulates 10 Experience Points instead of 5, but 
a world of new Edges opens up to him as well. “Legendary 
Edges” allow heroes to accumulate followers, build castles, 
start massive corporations, and otherwise become major 
players in their campaign world. 

Legendary characters may also choose to improve an 
attribute every other Advance. A few Legendary Edges are 
included in this book. Many more are quite specific to their 
particular campaign worlds, and so are covered in other 
Savage Settings.

Skills 
1) Race
• Choose any race available in your setting. 
2) Traits
• Your hero starts with a d4 in each attribute, and has 5 
points with which to raise them. Raising an attribute a die 
type costs 1 point.

point up to the linked attribute. Going over the linked attribute 
costs 2 points per level. 
• Charisma is equal to the total bonuses or penalties given 
by Edges and Hindrances. 
• Pace is 6”. 
• Parry is equal to 2 plus half Fighting. 
• Toughness is equal to 2 plus half Vigor. Go ahead and 
add the bonus granted by the armor worn on your torso to 
this value as well for speed’s sake, but remember it may not 
count if attacks target other parts of the body. 
3) Edges & Hindrances
• You gain additional points for taking up to one Major 
Hindrance (2 points) and two Minor Hindrances (1 point each). 
For 2 points you can:

Chapter Two: 
Gear 
In the following section is a sampling of gear from the ancient 
era to the near future. Below are some notes you’ll need to 
understand the equipment lists. 

3RB: The weapon has a three-round burst selector (see 
page 72). 

AP (Armor Piercing): The weapon or round ignores this 
many points of Armor. A weapon with an AP value of 4, for 
instance, ignores 4 points of Armor. Excess AP is simply lost. 

Auto: This full-auto weapon may fire in automatic (single 
shot) mode. 

Armor: This is the amount of Armor provided by the 
equipment, which is added to the wearer’s Toughness when 
the covered location is hit in combat. A character who wears 
multiple layers of armor only gains the highest bonus—they 
do not stack. Note that unless an attacker states otherwise, 
hits are always directed at the victim’s torso. 

Caliber: The number listed in parentheses after firearms is 
the caliber of bullet it fires. Use this when figuring ammunition 
costs or trying to figure out if the ammo from one weapon fits 
in another. 

Cost: Equipment prices are relative both to the starting funds 
of $500 and to their tech level, so a Springfield musket doesn’t 
really cost $250 in 1862. That’s just the “worth” of the weapon 
relative to the tech level and the typical setting it’s intended 
for. Remember that when comparing the $150 musket to the 
$150 AK47—the weapons are both “standard” for the typical 
environment they’re found in, even though the AK is vastly 
superior to the musket. Characters in military campaigns 
shouldn’t buy equipment at all—they’re simply assigned their 
gear. Some items simply list “Military” as their cost, meaning 
they are typically bought by large national militaries and then 
supplied to the troops under their command. Such weapons 

are not normally available on the open market. 

Economies are critical to balancing game worlds, so the 
Game Master is encouraged to re-price goods for his particular 
campaign. 

Damage: Damage is listed in terms of dice. Projectile 
weapons have fixed damage (such as 2d6). Melee weapons 
have damage based on the wielder’s Strength die plus another 
die, as listed under individual weapon entries. A dagger, for 
instance, inflicts Str+1d4 damage. 

Double Tap: The weapon can rapidly fire two rounds. Rather 
than rolling twice, add +1 to the Shooting and damage rolls. 

HW (Heavy Weapon): The weapon can affect vehicles or 
other devices with Heavy Armor. 

HE (High Explosive): High explosive rounds use a 
burst template, the size of which is noted in the weapon or 
ammunition’s notes. See the rules for Area of Effect attacks 
in Chapter Three. 

Minimum Strength: A character whose Strength is lower 
than the weapon die can use the weapon, but there are 
penalties. First, the weapon die can’t be higher than his 
Strength die. So if a scrawny kid (d4 Str) picks up a long 
sword (d8), he rolls 2d4 damage, not d4+d8. A brawny hero 
with Str d10 rolls d10+d8 when using the same long sword. 

Second, if the Strength die isn’t at least equal to the weapon 
die, the attacker doesn’t get any of the weapon’s inherent 
bonuses, such as +1 Parry or Reach. He still retains any 
penalties, however (like –1 Parry). 

If a weapon has a damage listed as Str+d8+2, for instance, 
then the minimum Strength the wielder must have is a d8. The 
bonus merely indicates the weapon is more lethal than other 
Str+d8 varieties (typically because it is magical or enhanced 
in some way). 

48 

Encumbrance


Some ranged weapons list a minimum Strength to use as 
well. A character with a lower Strength can use the weapon, 
but suffers a –1 penalty to his attack roll for every step of 
difference between his Strength and the minimum Strength 
required. The penalty is ignored if the weapon can be braced 
on a bipod or other support. 

Parry +X: The weapon adds the bonus to the character’s 
Parry score when used. 

Range: This lists the weapon’s Short, Medium, and Long 
range. Ranges are listed in inches so that you can use a ruler 
to move, shoot, and fight on the table-top with miniatures. 
Each inch is equal to 2 yards in the real world, so that 5” is 
really 10 yards, or 30 feet. 

Weapon ranges are “effective” ranges for the table-top. 
If you need to know the real world range of a weapon (for 
battles that don’t take place on the table-top, for instance), 
multiply each range bracket by 2.5. A tank round with a Long 
range of 300, for example, has a “real world” Long range of 
750”, or 1500 yards. 

Rate of Fire: This is the maximum number of shots that 
may be taken by this weapon per action. Unless a weapon 
says otherwise, the user can fire up to the weapon’s Rate of 
Fire (rather than its full Rate of Fire). If a single shot is taken, 
it uses a single round of ammunition and does not incur any 
recoil penalties. Two or more shots with such weapons always 
incurs the –2 autofire penalty. 

Reach: Weapons with “reach” allow their user to make 
Fighting attacks at the listed range. A reach of 1”, for example, 
allows a character to strike a target 1” distant. Weapons 
without a reach value can only strike targets at arm’s length 
(adjacent). 

Reach can be very important when fighting from horseback 
and against mounted foes (see page 74). 

Reloading: Antique weapons, such as muskets and 
crossbows, are very slow to reload. Each weapon tells you 
how many actions it requires to reload, such as 1/3, which 
means the weapon can fire every third round if the firer does 
nothing but load every action. Characters can load and walk 
at no penalty. If the character tries to run and load, he must 
make an Agility roll (at the usual –2 penalty for running). 
Failure simply means no progress toward reloading was 
made that action. 

Semi-Auto: The weapon fires on semi-auto and can take 
advantage of the double-tap rules (page 72). 

Snapfire Penalty: Certain weapons, such as sniper rifles, 
are very inaccurate if fired “from the hip” rather than using 
their excellent sights or scopes. If the character moves in the 
action he fires, he suffers a –2 penalty. 

Three Round Burst: The weapon can fire 3 rounds with one 
pull of the trigger. This adds +2 to the Shooting and damage 
rolls at the cost of the extra ammunition. 

In general, you shouldn’t worry about Encumbrance. 
Characters will usually carry no more than their characters 
think they actually need. But occasionally it may become 
dramatically important—such as during a chase or when 
attempting to lug a heavy treasure away from a roaring dragon! 
When that occurs, use the guidelines below. 

A character can carry five times his Strength die type in 
pounds without incurring any penalties. This is called his 
“Load Limit.” A character with a Strength of d8, for example, 
can comfortably carry 40 pounds. (Ignore normal clothes 
when figuring weight.) 

Carrying too much weight inflicts a –1 penalty for every 
additional multiple of your Load Limit. The penalty applies to 
all Agility and Strength totals, as well as skills linked to either 
of those two attributes. 

A hero with a d8 Strength, for example, has a Load Limit of 
40 pounds. He can carry 41-80 pounds at a –1 penalty to his 
Strength, Agility, and related skill rolls. He could also carry 
81-120 pounds at –2, or 121-160 pounds at –3. 

Characters cannot regularly carry weight that inflicts a 
penalty of more than –3. They may be able to lift greater 
weights (up to a –4 penalty) for a few short steps at the 
discretion of the GM, however.

Selected Gear Notes 
Ranged Weapons & Accessories 


Below are notes for some of the weapons, armor, and other 
devices you’ll find on the Equipment Lists. 

Armor 

Note that the weights listed for 
most large suits of armor such as 
hauberks, plate, and power armor, 
are figured for their “distributed” 
weight. This assumes the armor is 
properly fitted, which takes a Knowledge 
(Armorsmithing) roll, some basic tools, 
and 1d6 hours. If armor is not 
properly fitted (such as when 
wearing armor taken from a foe), 
the weight is typically doubled. 

Kevlar 

Kevlar offers 2 points of protection 
against most attacks. Kevlar 
weave “binds” spinning bullets 
and so negates up to 4 points of 
AP from bullets, and provides +4 
protection from them as well. 

Power Armor 

Power armor suits carry much 
of their own mass, hence the low weight values. Scout suits 
weigh 100 pounds when powered down, Battle suits weigh 
150, and Heavy Suits weigh 220 pounds. All power armor 
contains comm-units with a 5-mile range. Powered armor 
typically lasts for one week without recharge. It requires a 
special recharging facility and 10 hours to return to full power. 
The GM may decide suits lose power faster under excessive 
use. 

• 
Scout Suit: These suits are made for reconnaissance. 
In addition to the standard comm-unit, they are coated 
in stealth paint that adds +4 to Stealth rolls vs. radar and 
other automated detection systems (but not people). 
• 
Battle Suit: This is the standard power armor worn by 
most heavy troopers in futuristic settings. It increases 
Strength by one die type, adds +2 to Pace, and allows 
users to jump 2d6” horizontally or 1d6” vertically. A Heads 
Up Display provides targeting information for linked 
weapons, adding +1 to the wearer’s Shooting rolls. 
• 
Heavy Suit: Heavy suits (or assault suits) are designed 
for hard fighting under the most intense combat 
conditions. They subtract 2 from Pace and boost Strength 
by two die types. They mount at least one heavy weapon 
of some sort such as a flamethrower or a minigun, and 
feature enhanced targeting computers that add +2 to the 
character’s Shooting rolls. 
Shields 

If a character with a shield is hit by a ranged attack from 
the protected side, roll damage normally, but add the Armor 
bonus of the shield to the character’s Toughness (it acts as 
an obstacle). 


Bipods

Most full machine guns are also equipped with either an 
integral or detachable bipod. Once deployed, these provide 
a more stable shooting position and help control recoil. It 
takes one action to deploy a bipod and set the weapon up. 
Once in position the autofire penalty is reduced to –1. If the 
hero moves, this benefit is negated and he will have to spend 
another action to redeploy the bipod. 

Scopes

Optical scopes can be attached to all manner of firearms 
from rifles to hand guns, and magnify targets to make distance 
shooting easier. A scope provides a +2 Shooting bonus to 
shots at Medium Range or higher as long as the firer does 
not move this round. 

Shotguns

Shotguns fire a spread of metal balls (also called “shot”), 
and so do more damage at close range where the spread is 
less and more of the shot hits the target. Farther away, the 
shot spreads more and causes less damage. Because of 
the increased chance of hitting someone due to the spread, 
shotguns add +2 to their user’s Shooting rolls. They cause 
1d6 damage at Long range, 2d6 at Medium, and 3d6 at Short 
range. 

. 
Double Barrels: Shotguns with two attached barrels 
are called “double barrels.” If the attacker wants to fire both 
barrels at once, he rolls an additional Shooting die just like 
when firing Full Auto (plus Wild Die), including recoil (which 
cancels out the usual +2 for shotguns). Roll damage for each 
successful shot separately. 
. 
Slugs: Shotguns can also fire slugs. The attacker doesn’t 
get the +2 shotgun bonus to his Shooting roll, but the damage 
is 2d10 regardless of the range increment. 
Special Weapons 
Bouncing Betties

These deadly mines are designed to pop up into the air and 
rain shrapnel down from about head-height. Only full overhead 
cover offers an Armor bonus against such devices. Simply 
being prone offers no protection from these deadly explosives. 

Cannons 

Cannons can fire three different types of shells: solid 
shot, shrapnel, and canister. The crew can pick the type of 
ammunition to be loaded each time it reloads. 

Solid Shot is just that—big round balls made to batter walls 
or plow through packed ranks of troops. To fire, the leader 
of the crew makes a Shooting roll as usual. A target directly 
behind and adjacent to the first is also hit on a d6 roll of 1-3, 
and takes full damage. This continues until there are no more 
adjacent foes. 

Shrapnel is an explosive shell filled with metal balls, nails, 
and other scraps. The debris is hurled outward when the shell 
explodes, shredding lightly armored targets in a shower of 
steel. Shrapnel is an area effect attack, and uses the Medium 
Burst Template. 

50 

Canister is a shell made to detonate inside the barrel of the 
cannon. The jagged metal inside the “canister” then sprays 
out of the cannon to shred anything within its deadly cone like 
a giant shotgun. To determine the effects of canister, place 
a ruler in front of the cannon in the direction you want it to 
fire and make a Shooting roll with no range modifiers. If the 
shot is missed, move the far end of the ruler 1” left or right 
(roll randomly). 

Now place a Medium Burst Template at the near end of 
the ruler and move it directly forward along that path for 24”. 
Every target under the template is hit for 2d6 damage. Cover 
acts as Armor just as with any area effect weapon, meaning 
prone characters add +2 to their Toughness. 

. 
Reloading: Cannons require one action to reload with a 
crew of four, or two actions with less crewmen. 
. 
Line of Sight: Cannon crews must be able to see their 
targets to hit them. Howitzers, mortars, and bombards may 
fire at targets they cannot see (assuming they know roughly 
where the target is) at a –4 penalty, and double deviation 
(see Combat). 
Flamethrowers 

Flamethrowers include any device that squirts an incendiary 
liquid or even pure flame. To use it, the attacker places the 
small end of the Cone Template at the tip of his character’s 
weapon, and the large end on as many targets as he’s able. 
The attacker then makes a Shooting roll at +2. Defenders 
who make an Agility roll equal to or greater than the attacker’s 
Shooting total move out of the way and are unaffected. The 
rest suffer the weapon’s damage (typically 2d10) and roll to 
see if they catch fire (see Fire). 

Like other area effect weapons, flamethrowers typically 
bypass most body armor (see Area Effect Attacks). 

. 
Vehicular Flamethrowers: Military organizations often 
have flamethrowers with much longer ranges. The flame fired 
from a British Crocodile, for example, has a range of about 70 
yards (35”). The flame must be arced to reach these distances 
however, so a character may choose to use a Medium Burst 
Template instead of the Cone Template when using such 
weapons. The center of the template may be placed up to 
the maximum range of the particular flamethrower, as listed in 
its notes. This is treated just like any other area effect attack, 
though targets still get a chance to dodge out of the cone as 
detailed above. 
Grenades 

A character within the burst radius has two additional 
options. To pick up and throw the grenade before it goes off, 
he must make an Agility roll at –4 (or –2 if he was on Hold). 
Failure means it goes off and he takes an additional die of 
damage. 

. 
Covering Grenades: A character may also throw himself 
on a grenade. He takes double the normal dice of damage 
for his heroic act, but his total Toughness is subtracted from 
the damage inflicted on other characters in the blast radius. 
Allies won’t normally perform such a suicidal act, though the 
GM might rule otherwise in specific situations, such as when 
an ally has a “loyal” personality. 
Missiles 

Air-to-air (or space-to-space) weapons are designed to 
destroy enemy fighters and other small targets with a focused 
warhead. To activate, the pilot must first “capture” the target’s 
signature on his own control panel. This is accomplished by 
various means including heat-signature, radar, emissions, or 
even profile, depending on tech level. 

To get a lock, the pilot picks his target and must then succeed 
at an opposed Piloting roll. The attacker must subtract range 
modifiers from the Piloting roll just as if he were Shooting. 

Once locked, the pilot decides how many missiles to release 
(usually up to his full payload depending on his craft). At Short 
Range, the target has one round to evade. He has two rounds 
(and chances) at Medium Range, and three at Long Range. 

Evading a missile requires a Piloting roll at –4. Note that 
many craft contain additional evasion systems, such as chafe 
or flares, that add +4 to this roll if they’re of the right type (flares 
for heat-seeking missiles and chafe for radar-guided missiles). 

. 
Air to Ground Targets: Use the same procedure as 
above but the target makes a Driving or Boating roll against 
the attacker’s Piloting skill. 
. 
Surface to Air Missiles: As above, but the attacker makes 
a Shooting roll and the defender makes a Piloting roll. 
. 
Anti-Missile Systems: Larger ships often have antimissile 
systems designed to shoot down missiles with targeted 
lasers, walls of matter, or hails of lead. All systems require a 
modicum of skill and a lot of luck. First the crewman in charge 
of the particular AMS battery makes a Shooting roll minus the 
range. (Don’t subtract for the size or speed of the missile—the 
AMS already accounts for that.) Each successful hit has a 1 
in 6 chance of shooting down the torpedo. A Phalanx system 
with a RoF of 5, for example, rolls 5 dice, and each die that 
comes up a “1” shoots a missile down. 
. 
Obstacles: Evading prey can add +2 to the Piloting roll 
with substantial cover—such as asteroids, canyon walls, or 
the hull of a capital ship.

Note that most tank guns can fire Armor Piercing (AP) or High Explosive (HE) shells. A 37mm tank gun, for example, can 
fire an Armor Piercing round at 4d8 damage with an AP value of 3, or a High Explosive shell that causes 4d6 damage, has 
an AP of 3, and impacts with a Medium Burst Template.

Vehicles 


On the following pages are a number of sample vehicles for 
land, air, and water, including some military vehicles such as 
tanks and armored personnel carriers. 

Acc/Top Speed is the vehicle’s Acceleration and Top Speed 
in inches per round. The Top Speed of vehicles is set for 
battlefields (not the open highway, where they can usually 
double their speed). They’re adapted to work on the table-top, 
which means they’re not entirely realistic but work well for the 
game. Top Speed is typically half the vehicle’s operational 
speed for military vehicles, or one-quarter speed for civilian 
cars. Acceleration varies far more widely—use the examples 
from the Vehicle Table as a guide. 

Climb is a relative value used to determine if an aircraft has 
a better ability to gain altitude than another, as you’ll see in 
the Chase Rules on page 82. If converting vehicles of your 
own, use the following guidelines: 

Climb Example Aircraft 

–2 Balloons, steampunk helicopters 

–1 Craft which ascend relatively slowly, such as 

civilian helicopters 

0 WWII bombers, “heavy” aircraft, modern 

helicopters 

1 Light civilian aircraft, medium fighters 

2 Early light fighters 

3 Jets, very agile fighters, aircraft which ascend 

very quickly 

Previous editions of Savage Worlds used Climb as an actual 
measurement of inches an aircraft could ascend in a round. 
In setting books where Climb uses the previous Climb values, 
simply estimate based on the table above. 

Toughness is the vehicle’s base durability including Armor 
(in parentheses); vehicles with three numbers listed have 
different values for Front/Sides/Rear. Figuring Toughness for 
vehicles is very difficult due to different types of materials or 
armor, weak points vs. strong points, and so on, but in general 
you can use this chart to set the base Toughness: 

Weight in Tons Base Toughness 

<1 6–8 

2–4 9–11 

5–25 11–12 

26-60 13–14 

61-100 15–18 

100-200 19-22 

Every 100 tons thereafter +3–5 Toughness 

For Armor, figure the average thickness in inches of any 
metal on the vehicle and multiply by 2.5. This is a good 
baseline and will need more tinkering if it’s really important 
based on the type of metal, how much of the vehicle it covers, 
and so on. 

Passengers lists the number of crew plus any additional 
passengers it can transport. A notation of “2+8,” for example, 
means it has a crew of 2 and can carry 8 additional passengers. 

Cost is the average price of the vehicle. If the cost is 
“Military,” the cost is beyond the means of most characters 
and is typically purchased only by state militaries. 

Special Notes 

Air Bags: Passengers with air bags roll half the normal 
damage dice in a collision (round down), minus one. 

Amphibious: The vehicle can enter water without flooding or 
capsizing. See the individual descriptions for their movement 
rates while in water. 

AMCM (Anti-Missile Counter Measures): Some jets or 
spacecraft are equipped with anti-missile counter measures, 
such as chaff, flares, or decoy pods. The number of AMCM 
is a reflection of “bursts,” not actual flares or decoys. When 
used, an AMCM adds +2 to the user’s Piloting roll that round 
only for purposes of evading missiles. 

Fixed Gun: The vehicle’s weapon cannot rotate. 

Four Wheel Drive (4WD): These vehicles treat each inch of 
difficult terrain as 1.5 (instead of 2). 

Heavy Armor: Only weapons marked as Heavy Weapons can 
hurt this vehicle, regardless of the damage roll. This keeps a 
really lucky pistol shot from destroying a tank. Vehicles with 
Heavy Armor halve damage they take from colliding with other 
obstacles (including vehicles) that don’t have Heavy Armor. 

Heavy Weapon: This weapon can harm vehicles equipped 
with Heavy Armor. 

Hover: The vehicle is a hovercraft and can ignore most low 
terrain obstacles and water. 

Infrared Night Vision: Thermal imaging devices halve 
darkness penalties (round down) for heat-producing targets. 

Night Vision: “Starlight” and other night vision equipment 
eliminate Dim and Dark lighting penalties. 

Sloped Armor: In the best armored vehicles, armor is sloped 
so as to increase the chance that a hit will be deflected off 
the tank’s armor. Ballistic attacks against this target suffer a 
–2 penalty. 

Spacecraft: The vehicle is designed for use in outer space. 
Those followed with /Atmospheric can enter and exit planetary 
orbits as well. 

Stabilizer: A stabilizer reduces the Unstable Platform penalty 
for whatever weapon it’s attached to (usually its main gun 
unless stated otherwise) to –1 (rather than the usual –2). An 
Improved Stabilizer negates the penalty entirely. 

Stealth Paint: This is black paint that imposes a –4 to rolls 
made to spot the vehicle with sensors. 

Tracked: Unless otherwise noted, the vehicle is assumed 
to have wheels. Tracked vehicles can climb over most low 
obstacles such as logs, and treat each inch of difficult terrain 
as 1.5 (instead of 2). 

Weapons: Weapons are statted in the vehicle’s text. Note 
that the Rate of Fire for missiles and rockets indicates how 
many may be fired in one action.

Chapter Three: 
Game Rules 
The Savage Worlds rules provide a simple framework for 
your tales of adventure and glory. In this chapter we’ll show 
you how to make basic skill and attribute checks and make 
your combats Fast, Furious, and Fun! 

Wild Cards & Extras 

Your hero (a player character), and unique allies, villains, and 
monsters are collectively called “Wild Cards.” These beings 
have a little better chance at doing things, are a little tougher 
to put down, and are generally more detailed than common 
guards, minions, or lackeys—collectively called “Extras.” 

Wild Cards are noted with a design of some sort before 
their name, like this: 

..Serious Chapel
The actual Wild Card symbol varies and is usually themed 
for the particular setting, such as a skull-and-crossbones for 
a pirate game like 50 Fathoms, or the visage of the puritan 
himself in Solomon Kane®, but a symbol in front of the name 
always means the character is a Wild Card. 

Besides your own characters, it’s up to the Game Master to 
decide which characters are Wild Cards. The sergeant of the 
City Watch probably isn’t a Wild Card, but Sergeant Grimlock 
of the City Watch, a veteran of many wars and an important 
character in your campaign, certainly is. Skytch the Dragon is 
also a Wild Card, though his three young wyrms aren’t. You’ll 
see the difference between Wild Cards and Extras as you 
continue to read, but for later reference, the differences are: 

• 
Wild Cards can suffer multiple wounds. 
• 
Wild Cards always roll a Wild Die along with their Trait 
die when making tests and take the better of the two. 
Trait Tests 

To use an attribute or skill, simply roll the die assigned to it. 
If the result is a 4 or better (the “Target Number” or TN), the 
action is successful. For example, if a character’s Strength is 
a d6, he rolls a six-sided die. On a 4 or better, he’s successful. 

. 
Modifiers: Circumstances modify the die roll, such as 
shooting at something at long range or finding a well-hidden 
clue. Some things, such as ranged attacks, have standard 
modifiers. It’s up to the GM to determine any modifiers 
for more subjective tasks, such as spotting an ambush or 
eavesdropping on a conversation through a door. 
In general, an easy task, such as finding tracks in the mud, is 
made at +2. A difficult task, such as finding tracks by torchlight, 
is made at –2. A very difficult task, such as finding tracks in 
a rainstorm, is made at –4. 

Aces 

All Trait tests and damage rolls in Savage Worlds are open-
ended. That means that when you roll the highest number 
possible on a die (a 6 on a d6, an 8 on a d8, and so on), you 
get to roll that die again and add it to the total. This is called 
an “Ace.” Any modifiers to the die roll should be tacked on 
after adding up an Aced roll. 

Raises 

Sometimes it’s important to know just how successful a Trait 
test was. Every 4 points over what you need for success is 
called a “raise.” If your hero needs a 4 to Shoot an opponent 
and rolls an 11, he hits with one raise (and would have two 
raises with a roll of 12). Figure raises after adjusting for any 
modifiers. 

62 

Bennies


Unskilled Attempts

If a character doesn’t have a skill for an action he’s 
attempting, he rolls a d4 and subtracts 2 from the total. Wild 
Card characters still get their Wild Die for these rolls (which 
are also subject to the –2 penalty). The GM may decide that 
a character has no chance at a particular skill if he has no 
training in it—such as performing surgery or flying a plane. 

Opposed Rolls

Sometimes rolls are “opposed” by an opponent. If two 
characters are wrestling for control of an ancient artifact, for 
example, they both make Strength rolls and compare results. 

When this happens, the acting character gets his Trait total 
first. If he wants to spend Bennies (see the next section), he 
does so now. When he’s satisfied with his total, his opponent 
gets to roll. The highest total wins. In a tie, the two foes 
continue to struggle with no clear victor. 

The winner of an opposed roll considers his opponent’s total 
as his TN for purposes of determining any raises. 

Cooperative Rolls

Sometimes characters may want to cooperate and help 
a friend complete some kind of urgent task. If two or more 
characters want to perform a task together (and the GM 
decides it’s possible for them to do so), the lead character 
makes his roll and adds +1 for every success and raise his 
companions achieved on their own rolls. This has a normal 
maximum of +4 for all tasks except those of Strength, which 
have no maximum. 

Characters may not make cooperative rolls if they don’t 
actually have the skill in question. (You can’t make default 
rolls to aid with Boating, for example, if your character doesn’t 
actually have the Boating skill.) 

Group Rolls

When you want to make a noncombat Trait roll for a group of 
Extras, roll one Trait die as usual along with a Wild Die. Take 
the better of the two as always and treat this as the group’s 
total. This way you get a nice average without having to make 
individual Fear rolls for every Extra who sees a dragon, or 
watch one clumsy soldier ruin a stealthy approach for his 49 
companions. 

The Wild Die 

Extras roll a single die as described above. But Wild Cards 
roll an extra d6 and take the highest of their normal die or the 
“Wild Die” when making skill or attribute rolls. Wild Dice are 
rolled just like the Trait die, and can Ace as well (see above). 

. 
Critical Failure: The downside is that snake-eyes (double 
1s) on one of these rolls is a critical failure. The GM gets to 
make up something rotten to happen to your character. That’s 
the price Fate charges for making someone a hero. 
Example: Buck Savage, international adventurer, 

faces wild-eyed cultists. He has a d10 Shooting and 

rolls his d6 Wild Die. The Wild Die comes up 4, but 

he Aces (a 10) on the d10. He sets the Wild Die aside 

and rolls the d10 again. He gets another 10, then rolls 

again and gets a 3. His total is (10+10+3=) 23! 

Every now and then the dice may not work for you. That’s 
why Savage Worlds gives you, the player, a little control over 
your hero’s fate. 

Every player starts each game session with three “Bennies” 
(American slang for “benefits”), represented by gaming stones 
or other tokens that signify a little bit of good luck or fate. 
The Game Master may also give you more Bennies for great 
roleplaying, overcoming major obstacles, or even entertaining 
everyone with an outlandish action, side-splitting comment, 
or other memorable act. (Tips for awarding Bennies can be 
found in the Game Master’s section on page 124.) 

You can use Bennies to reroll any Trait test. Make the entire 
roll from scratch. If you’re firing three shots on full-auto and 
don’t like the results, pick up all three dice and your Wild Die 
and roll again. You can keep spending Bennies and rerolling 
as long as you like, and take the best of your attempts. If you 
roll a 5, for example, and a Benny gets you a 4, keep the 
original 5 instead. 

Bennies cannot be spent on tables, damage rolls (unless 
a character has the No Mercy Edge), or any other roll that 
isn’t a Trait roll. 

. 
Soak Rolls: Bennies can also be used to save your bacon 
from deadly attacks. Choose carefully where you spend them! 
See Damage for complete information on how to make Soak 
rolls. 
Game Master Bennies 

Game Masters get Bennies too. At the start of each session, 
the GM gets one Benny for each player character. He may use 
these for any of his villains throughout the course of the game. 

Each of the GM’s Wild Cards also gets two Bennies per 
game session. They can use these or any of the Bennies in 
the common pool to save their evil skins, but they can’t share 
their own Bennies with other nonplayer characters. 

As with heroes, Bennies are not saved between sessions. 


Official Savage Worlds Bennies are available for all our 
current settings at www.peginc.com.

Combat 
The very name says it all—whether they are the blood-
soaked plains of Mars or the corpse-strewn battlefields of 
the far future—these are Savage Worlds and there will be 
violence. We recommend using miniatures or markers of some 
sort so that players understand their surroundings and can 
use the terrain to their advantage. If miniatures aren’t your 
thing, see the sidebar on page 65. 

. 
Distance: Because the game assumes you are using 
terrain or a battle-mat and standard 28mm miniatures, 
movement and weapon ranges are listed in inches. If you 
need to translate that to regular distance, each inch is equal 
to 2 yards. 
If the GM needs a different scale to accommodate a larger 
battle, such as a long-range firefight between tank platoons, 
simply divide weapon and movement ranges as needed. 

. 
Time: When a fight breaks out, game time breaks down into 
rounds of six seconds each. Ten rounds, then, is one minute. 
Using Allies

Allied Extras are divided up among all the players to control. 
This is a very important part of Savage Worlds because our 
settings often feature allied bands of skilled hirelings, fellow 
grunts, or loyal retainers, and the game is designed to handle 
them quickly and easily. It’s also designed for the players to 
control them—not the Game Master. 

It doesn’t matter whether or not the characters control the 
allies, only that the players do. This keeps everyone involved 
in the action even if his hero is out of the fight, and makes 
running large combats much easier and fun for everyone. Of 
course the GM can always take charge of Extras when the 
need arises, but with good roleplayers, this should rarely be 
necessary. Some tips for the Game Master on using Allies 
can be found on page 125. 

Initiative 

The action in Savage Worlds is fast and furious. To help the 
Game Master keep track of who goes in what order and add a 
little randomness to the game, we use a single deck of playing 
cards with both Jokers left in to determine everyone’s initiative. 

Deal in characters as follows: 

• Every Wild Card is dealt a single card. Any allies under that 
player’s control act on his initiative card as well. 
• Each group of Game Master characters, such as all 
zombies, all wolves, and so on, share a card. 
Exactly which nonplayer character groups get their own 
cards is up to the GM. If he wants to break his 30 zombies into 
5 groups of 6, that’s fine. Your goal is to do whatever makes 
running the battle as quick and easy as possible. Generally, 
Wild Cards and other unique characters get their own card. 

. 
Shuffle: 
Shuffle the deck after any round in which a Joker 
was dealt. 
64 

Games Without Miniatures 


. 
Large Groups: In very large groups, or time-sensitive 
games, the Game Master might want to try dealing a single 
card per side (heroes and villains). On the heroes’ turn, simply 
start at one end of the group and work quickly around. This 
will speed things up dramatically if that’s more important than 
varying initiative order. If one or more characters have Level 
Headed or Quick, let that apply to the draw (but only once). 
The Countdown 

Once the cards are dealt, the Game Master starts the round 
by counting down from the Ace to the Deuce, with each group 
resolving its actions when its card comes up. 

. 
Ties: Ties are resolved by suit order: Spades are first, then 
Hearts, Diamonds, and Clubs (reverse alphabetical order). 
Jokers 

When a player draws a Joker, his character can go whenever 
he wants in the round, even interrupting another character’s 
action if he wants. In addition, add +2 to all Trait tests this 
round, and +2 to damage totals as well! 

Hold 

A hero may choose to wait and see what happens by taking 
a Hold action. He may then go later in the round if he chooses. 
A Held action lasts until it’s used. If a character has a Held 
card when a new round starts, he’s not dealt in. 

If a character is Shaken while on Hold, he immediately loses 
his “Hold” status and any remaining actions for the round. If 
the victim soaks the attack and avoids the Shaken result, he 
remains on Hold. 

. 
Interrupting Actions: If a character on Hold wants to 
interrupt an action (including a rival who was also on Hold), 
he and the opponent make opposed Agility rolls. Whoever 
rolls highest goes first. In the rare case of a tie, the actions 
are simultaneous. 
Surprise

Combat often starts before everyone involved is prepared. 
An ambush, a sudden double-cross, or a trap might all give 
one side in a fight an edge over the other. 

When this happens, the side that started the fight is not dealt 
cards but begins the fight on Hold. Victims of the surprise 
attack must make Notice rolls. Those who make it are dealt 
in as usual. Those who fail get no card in the first round of 
combat. 

Design Note - Action Cards 

Some new players have been hesitant to use cards 

for initiative. We’ve presented optional die-rolling 

systems in previous editions, but the truth is, the 

card-based initiative system works and is a lot of fun. 

If you’re new to it, try it. 

We’ve found the excitement of drawing a Joker—or 
getting a Queen when the monster that’s about to kill 
your hero is on a Jack—is a major part of the game and 
those who give it a chance quickly realize how well it 
works for Savage Worlds—particularly when it comes 

to keeping track of large groups of heroes and villains. 

Weapon ranges, character and vehicle movement rates, 
and even the templates are all based on using figures on a 
table-top. That’s why they’re measured in inches rather than 
yards, miles-per-hour, and so on. 

But many times you won’t want to use miniatures. Here are 
some quick and dirty ways to handle those situations that are 
usually dependent on table-top measurements. 

. 
Range: The GM should simply decide how far away targets 
are. Mentally, it’s much easier for most people to think in yards. 
Remember that every two yards is one inch on the table-top, 
so if a target is about 20 yards away, it’s 10” away. 
. 
Templates: Without exact placement of miniatures it’s 
tricky to know how many foes might be caught by an area-
effect attack (like a grenade). For these occasions, figure a 
Small Burst Template affects 1d3 foes, a Medium Burst or 
Cone Template affects 2d4 foes, and a Large Burst Template 
catches 2d6 opponents. 
Allies adjacent or in combat with these foes suffer damage 
as well unless the attack hits with a raise. 

Movement 

Characters may move their full Pace (usually 6” for humans) 
in a round. This is considered a free action and doesn’t inflict 
a penalty to any other actions, such as firing a weapon or 
taunting a foe. 

. 
Crawling: A character may crawl 2” per turn. This counts 
as being prone when being fired upon. 
. 
Crouching: A character may move while crouching at 
half Pace. He may run while crouched (halve his total Pace 
after rolling for running). Ranged attacks against him suffer 
a –1 penalty. 
. 
Going Prone: A character may fall prone at any time during 
his action. Getting up costs 2” of movement. See Prone on 
page 75 for the benefits of being prone. 
. 
Difficult Ground: Difficult ground such as mud, steep hills, 
or snow, slows characters down. Count each inch of difficult 
ground as two inches for purposes of movement. 
. 
Jumping: Acharacter can jump 1” horizontally from a dead 
stop, or up to 2” with a “run and go.” A successful Strength 
roll grants one extra inch of distance. 
Running

A character may run an additional 1d6” during his turn if he 
wishes. Characters suffer a –2 penalty (the standard multi-
action penalty) to all other actions made while running. 

. 
Group Running Rolls: When rolling for a group of 
nonplayer characters, villains, or monsters, the GM or 
controlling player makes a single running roll. The whole 
group doesn’t actually have to run—it’s just a convenient way 
to save a little time in the heat of battle. 
65 

Actions 


Characters perform “actions” when their card comes up each 
round. A character can move (see Movement) and perform 
one regular action—attacking, running, casting a spell, and 
so on—without penalty. 

Characters can perform a multitude of actions when their 
card comes up in combat. The most common actions are 
making Tests of Will, using a power, or attacking with the 
Fighting or Shooting skill. These are all covered on the 
following pages. 

Simpler actions such as readying an item, drawing a sword, 
or other quick tasks usually take one action. More complex 
actions, such as lighting a torch, digging through a backpack to 
find a small item, and so on, might require a random amount of 
time (such as 1d6 rounds). The Game Master has the final say. 

. 
Readying Weapons: Drawing a weapon usually takes an 
entire round, but a character can do it faster if she wants. This 
is an action, however, and so inflicts the standard multi-action 
penalty of –2 to the character’s attack roll. 
Drawing two weapons at once, drawing a weapon from a 
difficult location (such as an ankle holster or inside a coat), or 
drawing a large or unwieldy weapon (a rifle, a shotgun, etc.), 
still inflicts a single –2 penalty, but requires an Agility roll. If 
the roll is failed, the weapons are drawn but the character 
may not attack that round. 

Multiple Actions

Characters may perform multiple 
actions such as Intimidating 
someone while blasting away 
with a shotgun, running and 
Fighting, attacking with 
a weapon in each 
hand, and so on. 

Two important rules apply: 

• 
A character can’t fire more than his weapon’s Rate of 
Fire in one round 
• 
A character may not make more than one Fighting attack 
with the same weapon in one round 
In essence, a hero may not perform the same action twice 
in a round—he can’t make two simultaneous Intimidation rolls 
or cast two different spells. He could make a Fighting and a 
Shooting attack if he had a gun in one hand and a knife in the 
other, however, and could even issue a Taunt at the same time. 
He could only make two Fighting attacks if he had a knife in 
each hand, however (or had the Frenzy Edge). 

Each additional action attempted in a round subtracts 2 
from all the hero’s rolls. If an adventurer wants to fire a gun 
with one hand and slice at an adjacent foe with a sword in 
the other, for instance, he subtracts 2 from both rolls. If he 
also wanted to make a Test of Wills against someone at the 
same time, he subtracts 4 from all his rolls. 

Wild Cards get their Wild Die on each action as usual. 
A moving character may perform these actions at different 
points in his movement, but still suffers the multi-action 
penalty. This might seem a little odd in practice—a character 
might shoot a pistol, move a few inches, then issue a Taunt— 
suffering a –2 penalty to both even though the Taunt roll has 
yet to be resolved—so make sure the player is committed to 
both actions before resolving either. 

. 
Free Actions: Some minor actions are “free” and don’t 
inflict multi-action penalties. Speaking a short sentence or 
two, moving up to the character’s Pace, falling prone, resisting 
opposed rolls, or dropping an item, are all examples of free 
actions. 
. 
One Wild Die Per Action: When Wild Cards roll multiple 
dice for a single action, such as when firing a machine gun, 
66 

they roll only one Wild Die. A warrior with the Frenzy Edge, 
for example, rolls two Fighting dice and one Wild Die. He can 
use the Wild Die’s total to replace either of his Fighting dice 
if he chooses. The Wild Die must either replace one of the 
regular dice or be ignored—it never adds another action or 
attack to the roll. 

Attacks 

The heart of Savage Worlds is its fast, furious combat. 
Here’s everything you need to know to decimate your foes 
and keep your hero alive. 

Melee Attacks 

The Target Number to hit an opponent is equal to the 
opponent’s Parry score (2 plus half his Fighting ability; that’s 
a 2 if he has no Fighting skill). 

. Bonus Damage: If your attack hits with a raise, add +1d6 
to your damage total as well! The d6 may Ace just like any 
other damage roll. 
Ranged Attacks

The Shooting skill covers everything from pistols to rocket 
launchers. The base TN to hit something at Short range is 4 
as usual. Shots at Medium range subtract 2 from the Shooting 
roll, and shots at Long range subtract 4 from the roll. 

. Bonus Damage: If you hit your target with a raise, add 
+1d6 to the damage total. This roll may Ace just like any other 
damage roll.

. Rate of Fire: The Rate of Fire is how many Shooting dice 
the character rolls when firing the weapon. These additional 
shots must be taken at the same time, and each point of RoF 
grants the hero another Shooting die. A pistol with a RoF of 
2, for example, gives a character two Shooting dice, which 
may be aimed at two different targets. 
A submachine gun with a RoF of 3, for example, allows the 
player to roll up to three Shooting dice at once at up to three 
different targets. These shots can be split among all possible 
targets as the player desires, but must all be taken at the same 
time. A shooter with an Uzi can’t fire one shot, then move and 
fire two more, for instance. 

Wild Cards roll one Wild Die with the Shooting roll, and can 
use it in place of one of the Shooting dice if they choose. 

Example: A special agent fires a submachine gun 
(RoF 3) at two terrorists. The agent is a Wild Card with 
a Shooting of d8, so he rolls 3d8 plus a Wild Die (d6). 
The player decides to put two shots into the closest 
terrorist and one at the further target. He rolls the two 
at the closest terrorist first, then rolls a third d8 for the 

second. He also rolls his Wild Die. 

He scores a hit on each with his Shooting dice 
and misses with the third, but his Wild Die hit so he 

replaces one of the failed Shooting dice with it and 

gets his maximum three hits (since that was his RoF). 

. Cover: Attackers suffer a penalty when attempting to hit 
a target behind cover: 
• 
Light Cover: Characters subtract 1 from their attack rolls 
if half or less of their target is obscured. 
• 
Medium Cover: The penalty is increased to –2 if more 
than half of the target is hidden from view. This is the 
usual penalty for attacking a prone character (see Prone). 
• 
Heavy Cover: The penalty is –4 if only a small part of the 
target is visible (prone beside a tree, behind a high wall, 
peeking around the corner of a building, etc.). 
• 
Near Total Cover: Attacking through a very tight opening 
that provides near total cover, such as an arrow slit, 
subtracts 6 from enemy attack rolls. 
. Illumination: Attacking a poorly-illuminated target is more 
difficult than a similar attack with good lighting, and incurs the 
following penalties: 
• 
Dim: Twilight, light fog, night with a full moon, and so on 
subtract 1 from combatants’ attack rolls. 
• 
Dark: Normal darkness with some ambient light (starlight, 
partial moon) inflicts a –2 penalty, and targets aren’t 
visible outside of 10”. 
• 
Pitch Darkness: Targets aren’t visible at all in pitch 
blackness, but if a character knows roughly where a 
victim is (he can hear him, target is in a confined space, 
a glint of light shines off his blade, etc.), he may be 
attacked at –4. 
. Firing Blind: Sometimes a character may want to fire at 
targets they have no fix on whatsoever. In these cases, allow 
the attacker to make a Shooting roll at –4 as above. Should 
he hit, the target may make a simple Stealth roll to ignore the 
attack (it misses).The Stealth roll is made at –2 if the attack 
was made with a RoF of 3 or more. 
Damage 

After a successful close combat or ranged hit, the attacker 
rolls damage. Ranged weapons do fixed damage as listed 
in the Gear section. Most pistols, for example, cause 2d6 
damage. 

Hand weapons cause damage equal to the attacker’s 
Strength die plus a second die, which depends on the 
weapon. A barbarian with a d12 Strength and a long sword 
(d8 damage) rolls d12+d8 damage. Even though Strength is 
used to determine melee damage, this isn’t a Trait roll. Wild 
Cards don’t add a Wild Die to the roll and they can’t spend 
Bennies if they’re unhappy with the results. 

All damage rolls can Ace. 

. Unarmed Combat Damage: An unarmed combatant rolls 
only his Strength die. 
. Bonus Damage: Well-placed attacks are more likely to hit 
vital areas, and so do more damage. If your hero gets a raise 
on his attack roll (regardless of how many raises), he adds 
+1d6 to the final total. This roll may also Ace! 
67 

Applying Damage

The damage of an attack is compared to the victim’s 
Toughness just like a Trait roll (though it isn’t one so you can’t 
spend a Benny on it). With a success, the victim is Shaken. 
For each raise over his Toughness he suffers a wound as 
well, as shown below: 

• 
Success: The character is Shaken. If he was already 
Shaken, he suffers a wound and remains Shaken. To 
cause a wound, the latter Shaken result must come 
from a physical attack of some kind—not a Test of Wills 
or other maneuver. 
• 
Raise: The character suffers a wound for every raise 
on the damage roll, and is Shaken. (When wounds are 
caused, it doesn’t matter if the victim was already Shaken 
beforehand.) 
Example: A barbarian hits an ogre with a Toughness 

of 11. The barbarian’s friend, a rogue, has already 

taunted the beast (a Test of Wills, see page 75) and 

Shaken it. 

If the barbarian’s damage is 11-14, that’s a success 
and would normally Shake the ogre. Since it’s already 
Shaken, he suffers a wound and remains Shaken. 

If the barbarian’s damage is 15+—a raise or more— 
he’d simply cause wounds. The ogre is already 
Shaken, and since a wound was caused, there’s no 
further effect. 

Damage Effects 


Design Note - Up, Down, or Off the Table 
One of the core principles of Savage Worlds is that 
figures are up, down, or off the table. This assumes 
you’re using figures, but the concept applies even if 
you’re not. Up, down, or off the table means the Game 
Master can have dozens of actors (allies, enemies, 
etc.) and easily keep track of them all because 
those that are up are fine and operating normally, 
those that are down are Shaken, and those who are 
Incapacitated are removed. Understanding that may 
help you better understand why the Shaken rules work 
the way they do. 

Of course the Game Master shouldn’t fill the table 
with miniatures simply because he can. Instead, the 
ability to handle such large fights is a tool to let the 
player characters adopt different strategies than they 
would in most games where this just isn’t practical. 
Want to recruit a warband to help you take down that 
orc horde? No problem! Want to add several platoons 
of tanks to help storm that enemy trench? Can do! 
One of our most infamous convention scenarios is 
a dozen tanks and 50 soldiers per side supporting a 
raid by the player characters—all handled in about two 
hours with roleplaying, puzzle-solving, and a massive 
combat. The power and flexibility to do that, while still 
maintaining a high level of character customization and 
detail, is one of the features we think makes Savage 
Worlds so special. 

Damage can result in three effects: Shaken, wounds, and 
Incapacitation. 

Shaken 

If the damage of an attack is a simple success (0-3 points 
over Toughness), the target is Shaken. Shaken characters 
are rattled, distracted, or momentarily shocked. They aren’t 
stunned but are temporarily suppressed and may hesitate. 

On their action, Shaken characters must attempt to recover 
from being Shaken by making a Spirit roll: 

• 
Failure: The character remains Shaken. She can only 
perform free actions. 
• 
Success: The character is no longer Shaken and may 
act normally. 
. 
Spending Bennies: A player may spend a Benny at any 
time to remove her Shaken status (even when it is not her 
turn). 
Wounds 

Every raise on the damage roll inflicts a wound. 

Wounded Extras are removed from play. They’re dead, 
injured, or otherwise out of the fight. 

Wild Cards can take three wounds and still function. 
If another wound would be caused after that, they’re 
Incapacitated (see below). Wild Cards never have more than 
three wounds—anything beyond that is just considered three 
wounds and Incapacitated (see below). 

. 
Wound Penalties: Each wound a Wild Card suffers causes 
a –1 cumulative penalty to his Pace (minimum of 1) and to all 
further Trait tests—up to the maximum of a hero’s 3 wounds. 
A hero with 2 wounds, for example, suffers a –2 penalty to 
his Pace and any Trait tests. 
. 
Timing: Characters sometimes take multiple hits on the 
same Action Card. Resolve each damage roll separately 
and completely before moving on to the next (including any 
Soak rolls). 
Incapacitation

Incapacitated characters aren’t necessarily dead, but are 
generally too beaten, battered, or bruised to do anything 
useful. They may not perform actions and are not dealt Action 
Cards in combat. Incapacitated Extras are removed from play. 

Wild Cards are Incapacitated if they suffer more than three 
wounds (cumulatively or all at once). When a Wild Card 
becomes Incapacitated, make an immediate Vigor roll: 

• 
Total of 1 or Less: The character dies. 
• 
Failure: Roll on the Injury Table. The Injury is permanent 
and the victim is Bleeding Out (see below). 
• 
Success: Roll on the Injury Table. The Injury goes away 
when all wounds are healed. 
• 
Raise: Roll on the Injury Table. The Injury goes away in 
24 hours, or when all wounds are healed. 
68 

Injury Table 
Soak Rolls 


2d6 Wound 

2 Unmentionables: If the injury is permanent, 
reproduction is out of the question without 
miracle surgery or magic. There is no other 
effect from this result. 

3-4 Arm: Roll left or right arm randomly; it’s 
unusable like the One Arm Hindrance (though 
if the primary arm is affected, off-hand 
penalties still apply to the other). 

5-9 Guts: Your hero catches one somewhere 
between the crotch and the chin. Roll 1d6: 
1-2 Broken: Agility reduced a die type 
(minimum d4). 
3-4 Battered: Vigor reduced a die type 
(minimum d4). 
5-6 Busted: Strength reduced a die type 
(minimum d4). 

10 Leg: Gain the Lame Hindrance (or the One Leg 
Hindrance if already Lame). 
11-12 Head: A grievous injury to the head. Roll 1d6: 

1-2 Hideous Scar: Your hero now has 

the Ugly Hindrance. 

3-4 Blinded: An eye is damaged. 
Gain the One Eye Hindrance (or 
the Blind Hindrance if he only 
had one good eye).

 5-6 Brain Damage: Massive 

trauma to the head. Smarts 

reduced one die type (min d4). 

. 
Bleeding Out: The injured character must 
make a Vigor roll at the start of each round after 
the one in which he was injured and before Action 
Cards are dealt: 
• 
Success: 
The victim must roll again next 
round, or every minute thereafter if not in combat. 
• 
Raise: The victim stabilizes and no further rolls 
are required. 
• 
Failure: The character dies from blood loss. 
Other characters may stop a victim’s bleeding 
by making a Healing roll. If successful, the victim 
stabilizes immediately and no further rolls are 
required. This use of the Healing skill just stops the 
bleeding. See page 78 for the use of the Healing skill 
to recover actual wounds. 

A character may spend a Benny to make a “Soak” roll, 
which is a Vigor check. A success and each raise reduces the 
number of wounds suffered from that attack by one. 

If the character Soaks all of the wounds from an attack, 
he removes his Shaken condition too (even from a previous 
source). Don’t count the wound modifiers he’s about to suffer 
when making this roll. 

. 
Timing: A character may only make one Soak roll per 
attack. If a Soak roll eliminates 2 of 3 wounds, for instance, 
a hero can’t make another Soak roll to eliminate the third 
wound. (The hero could spend a second Benny to reroll the 
Vigor roll as usual, however.) 
. 
Shaken: 
A character can also spend a Benny to 
immediately eliminate a Shaken condition (and act if it’s his 
action). This can be done at any time—even just after a failed 
Spirit roll to recover. 
69 

Situational Combat Rules Situational Combat Rules 
Below are a number of rules for special maneuvers 
characters might perform during furious combat. 

Aim 

A character who spends a full round aiming (no movement 
allowed) may add +2 to his Shooting or Throwing roll in the 
following round versus whatever he aimed at (a person, 
vehicle, etc.). Aiming for multiple rounds has no extra effect. 

Area Effect Attacks 

Grenades, spell effects, and other attacks that cover a large 
area are “area effect attacks.” The three most common size 
attacks have been made into Small, Medium, and Large Burst 
Templates, found on page 180 and on our website. 

To attack with an area effect weapon, the character places 
the template on the table (or picks where he wants the center 
of the blast to be) and makes a Shooting or Throwing roll. If 
the attack is successful, the blast is centered where desired. 
Everything under (or partially under) the template is affected, 
rolling damage separately for each Wild Card or group of 
Extras. 

Failure means the blast deviates. Just how far depends on 
whether it was thrown or launched, and what range bracket the 
target was in (Short, Medium, or Long). Roll 1d6” for thrown 
weapons (such as grenades) and 1d10” for fired projectiles. 

Multiply by 1 for Short range, 2 for Medium, and 3 for Long. 

Next roll a d12 and read it like a clock facing to determine 
the direction the missile deviates. A weapon can never deviate 
more than half the distance to the original target. That keeps 
things from going behind the thrower. 

Targets use their lowest armor value against area effect 
damage—armor must cover the entire body without gaps to 
provide any protection at all. 

. 
Cover: Targets who are prone or behind cover still get 
some protection from area effect attacks. In these cases, the 
modifier they would normally receive against ranged attacks 
acts as that many points of Armor instead. A character in major 
cover, like a foxhole, negates four points of damage from a 
blast if he’s caught within it. 
. 
Diving for Cover: Thrown weapons with a blast effect 
(such as grenades) and artillery allow potential targets a 
chance to move out of the area of effect. Give targets who 
saw the danger coming an Agility roll at –2 to jump out of the 
way and avoid the damage. If successful, move the character 
just outside the template (his choice exactly where). Grenades 
can be thrown back as well (see Grenades on page 51). 
Automatic Fire 

Automatic weapons (those with an RoF of 2 or higher) 
fire much faster—and inherently differently—than regular 
firearms. 


70 

To attack with a full-auto weapon, roll a number of Shooting 
dice equal to the weapon’s Rate of Fire. Compare each die 
separately to the Target Number to see if it hit. If the weapon 
has a RoF of 3, for example, a Wild Card rolls three Shooting 
dice plus a Wild Die and uses the best three results. 

Note that Wild Cards roll their Shooting dice plus a Wild Die. 
They still can’t hit with more shots than the weapon’s Rate 
of Fire, however. 

. 
Recoil: Fully automatic fire is typically inaccurate because 
of the recoil between each shot. Subtract 2 from the Shooting 
roll when firing full-auto (ignore the penalty when firing a single 
shot with such a weapon). 
. 
Full-Auto and Ammo: This system is somewhat abstract 
so that we don’t have to roll dice for every single bullet (though 
we treat them as such for game purposes). This means that 
each die rolled on full-auto represents a number of bullets 
equal to the weapon’s Rate of Fire when counting ammo, even 
though only one “bullet” can hit and cause damage from that 
die. Firing all three dice with a Thompson gun (Rate of Fire 
3), for example, consumes 9 bullets. 
Most automatic weapons can be set to fire full-auto or single 
shot. If a weapon has selectable automatic use (Auto), you can 
fire a single shot (and also ignore the full-auto penalty of –2). 

. 
Suppressive Fire: Instead of attacking specific targets, 
characters with fully automatic weapons can “spray” an area 
with lead in hopes of killing or suppressing a larger number of 
victims. To suppress an area, the attacker places the Medium 
Burst Template on the battlefield and makes a single Shooting 
roll (regardless of the weapon’s Rate of Fire). Include the 
standard modifiers for range, the full-auto penalty, and any 
other miscellaneous factors, but ignore the target’s modifiers 
if any (such as being prone or in cover—these come into play 
in another way as you’ll see below). If the attack misses, the 
spray is off-target and has no effect. 
If the attack is successful, all possible targets within the 
area make Spirit rolls, adding any cover modifiers they would 
normally have against ranged attacks to this roll. Those 
who fail are Shaken. Those who roll a 1 on their Spirit die 
(regardless of any Wild Dice) are actually hit by the attack 
and suffer damage normally. 

Suppressive fire uses five times the weapon’s Rate of Fire in 
bullets. A weapon with a Rate of Fire of 3, for example, uses 
15 bullets for suppressive fire. 

Example: Buck and Virginia, two pulp-era 

adventurers, are escaping from ancient ruins in a 

stolen biplane. Suddenly, they’re swarmed by an 
evil alligator shaman and his brainwashed minions. 
Virginia spins the plane’s Maxim gun around and fires. 
She uses suppressive fire to slow them down. 

She places a Medium Burst Template 16” away— 
that’s Medium Range for the Maxim—and rolls her 
Shooting. She gets a 13, –2 for full-auto, –2 for an 
unstable platform (the plane), and –2 for Medium 
range, for a total of 7. Success! The tribesmen in the 

template must roll their Spirit or be Shaken. Those 

who make it charge on through, but those who roll a 
1 are hit! 

Breaking Things

Occasionally a character may want to break something, 
such as a weapon, a lock, or a door. Use the Toughness 
values below for these kinds of objects. Use these rules for 
solid objects. Larger objects with many components (such as 
vehicles) take multiple hits as per the vehicle rules. 

Most anything can be broken given enough time and effort, 
so use this system only when attempting to break things in a 
hurry (such as during combat rounds). 

The Parry of an inanimate object is 2. The catch is that 
damage rolls against them don’t count bonuses from raises 
on the attack roll, nor Aces. Unlike a person or even a vehicle, 
an attack cannot hit a “vital” area on a lock or a door and 
thus do more damage. If an attack can’t do enough damage 
to destroy an object, it can’t destroy it (at least not quickly). 
This keeps characters from shattering swords with a feather 
and a lucky Strength roll. 

If the damage roll equals or exceeds the object’s Toughness, 
it’s broken, bent, shattered, or otherwise ruined. The GM 
decides the exact effects—such as whether a good strike 
opens a hole in a door or knocks it off its hinges. 

See Obstacles to attack through objects. 

. 
Damage Types: After the type of Object and its Toughness 
is the type of damage that can affect it. Swords do cutting or 
piercing damage, spears are piercing weapons, and so on. 
Bullets are considered piercing weapons, though shotguns 
do blunt damage at close range for the purpose of this table. 
The type of damage is important for objects because 
shooting a single bullet through a door, for instance, may 
penetrate it, but won’t destroy it. Only a blunt or cutting attack 
is likely to destroy a door in one shot.

Called Shots 

Use the following modifiers and effects when characters 
wish to target specific locations: 

• 
Limb (–2): An attack to a limb causes no additional 
damage but may ignore armor or have some other special 
effect (see the Disarm maneuver). 
• 
Head or Vitals (–4): The attacker gains +4 damage from 
a successful attack to these critical areas. The target must 
actually have vital areas, and the attacker must know 
where they are to gain this advantage. 
• 
Small Target (–4): Attacks against small targets such 
as the heart of a vampire or a missing scale on a large 
dragon’s chest are made at –4. The effect of success 
71 

depends on the situation—the vampire might die instantly, 
the missing scale may mean the dragon gets no armor, 
etc. If the GM has no particular effect in mind, it adds +4 
damage just like a shot to the head or vitals. 

• 
Tiny Target (–6): Particularly small or narrow targets, 
such as the eye-slit of a knight’s helmet, carry a –6 
modifier. The effects of a hit depend on the target. In the 
case of the knight, the blow ignores armor and inflicts +4 
damage because it’s a head shot (as above). 
Defend 

If a character’s only regular action is to defend, his Parry is 
increased by +2 until his next action. The defender may move 
normally while performing this maneuver, but no running or 
other actions are allowed. 

Disarm 

A character can try to make an opponent drop a weapon (or 
other object) with either a close combat or a ranged attack. 
To cause a disarm check, the attacker must first hit the 
opponent’s arm (–2, see Called Shots). The defender must 
then make a Strength roll. If the roll is less than the damage, 
he drops his weapon. The attacker may choose to make this 

a nonlethal attack with a melee weapon. Ranged attacks can 
be nonlethal if the attacker targets the weapon instead of the 
limb (generally –4 instead of –2). 

Double Taps & Three Round Bursts

A character with a semi-automatic weapon (such as a Colt 
.45, an M1 Carbine, or even an M16) can fire two shots in 
one action by “double-tapping.” Double tapping is a single 
Shooting roll that gives the user +1 to hit and damage but 
expends two rounds of ammunition. 

Many modern automatic weapons, such as the M16A2, have 
a selector switch that allows the user to go from single shot, 
to burst fire, to fully-automatic as a free action. Burst fire, or 
a Three Round burst, gives the user +2 to hit and damage, 
and uses exactly three rounds of ammunition. 

The Drop

Sometimes an attacker is able to catch a foe off-guard and 
gets “the drop” on him. This usually happens at a distance of 
only a few feet, but other situations may occur (a sniper on 
a nearby rooftop). 

Only the GM can determine when one character has 
obtained this kind of advantage over another. Usually it’s 

72 

when the victim is in the classic hostage pose, is completely 
unaware of the danger, or has been caught unarmed by an 
armed foe. The attacker is considered on Hold and adds +4 
to his attack and damage rolls should he decide to strike. 

Finishing Move

A completely helpless victim (bound, unconscious, etc.) may 
be dispatched with a lethal weapon of some sort as an action. 
This is automatic unless the GM decides there’s a special 
situation, such as a particularly tough or naturally armored 
victim, a chance for escape, and so on. 

The killer must usually dispatch his foe up close and 
personal, but the GM may occasionally let finishing moves 
be performed at range. 

Firing Into Melee

Occasionally heroes have to fire into the middle of handto-
hand fights. The trouble is that even though we might see 
figures standing perfectly still on the table-top, in “reality,” 
they’re circling each other, wrestling back and forth, and 
moving erratically. For that reason, firing into a tangle of 
people, such as a melee, is quite dangerous. Use the 
Innocent Bystander rules when this occurs (see below). 

Full Defense 

In addition to the usual Defend option, a character can go 
for a full defensive action. He makes a Fighting roll at +2 and 
uses the result as his Parry until his next action. This is a trait 
test, so he gets to roll his Wild Die as well. And, of course, 
the dice can Ace, and you can choose to use Bennies on the 
roll if you want to. 

Note that the character’s Parry never gets worse as a result 
of the roll. If the roll is lower than the hero’s Parry score, he 
keeps that instead (but gains no bonus from the full defense). 

A hero using the full defense maneuver cannot move at all, 
however. He’s doing everything he can to fend off whatever 
is attacking him. If he wants to move away as well, use the 
Defend maneuver instead. 

Ganging Up

Ganging up on a foe allows attackers to flank, exploit 
openings, and generally harass their outnumbered opponent. 

Each additional adjacent foe adds +1 to all the attackers’ 
Fighting rolls, up to a maximum of +4. If three warriors attack 
a single hero, for example, each of the three warriors gets a 
+2 bonus to their Fighting rolls. 

Grappling

Sometimes it’s best to restrain an opponent rather than 
beat him to a bloody pulp. That’s where grappling comes in. 

Grappling is an opposed Fighting roll that causes no 
damage. If the attacker wins, he’s entangled his foe. With a 
raise, his foe is also Shaken. 

Once entangled, the defender may attempt to break free 
on his next action. Both the defender and attacker pick either 
their Strength or Agility and then an opposed roll is made. If 
successful, the defender is free but the attempt consumes 
his action. If he does so with a raise, he’s free and may 
act normally. Failure means he is still entangled. Instead of 

breaking free the defender may attempt a different action but 
at a –4 penalty. 

After grappling, the attacker may attempt to damage his 
victim on subsequent rounds by making an opposed roll as 
above. On a success he does his Strength in damage (gaining 
the extra d6 for a raise as normal). 

Improvised Weapons

Heroes often find themselves fighting with objects that 
aren’t intended for use as weapons. Torches, vases, chairs, 
tankards, bottles, tools, and other mundane items are 
frequently pressed into service in combat. And sometimes 
characters find themselves using existing weapons in 
improvised ways, defending with a ranged weapon in melee 
or trying to throw a hand weapon not designed to be thrown. 

Such improvised weapons cause the wielder to suffer a 
–1 Fighting or Throwing penalty, as well as –1 to Parry. The 
Game Master is the final judge of an improvised weapon’s 
effectiveness. 

• 
Small Weapons: Range 3/6/12, Damage Str+d4, RoF 
1, Min Str d4, –1 attack and Parry 
• 
Medium Weapons: Range 2/4/8, Damage Str+d6, RoF 
1, Min Str d6, –1 attack and Parry 
• 
Large Weapons: Range 1/2/4, Damage Str+d8, Min Str 
d8, –1 attack and Parry 
Innocent Bystanders

When an attacker misses a Shooting or Throwing roll, it 
may sometimes be important to see if any other targets in the 
line of fire were hit. The GM should only use this rule when 
it’s dramatically appropriate—not for every missed shot in a 
hail of gunfire. 

Each miss that comes up a 1 on the Shooting die indicates 
a random adjacent character was hit. If the attacker was firing 
on full-auto or with a shotgun, a roll of 1 or 2 hits the bystander. 
Roll damage normally. 

Horses and other animals are possible targets when firing 
on mounted characters as well. 

It’s sometimes easier to hit an adjacent victim than the 
original target using this quick system. That may not be entirely 
realistic, but it’s fast and simple, it makes large groups of 
people vulnerable to missile fire, and best of all, increases 
the drama of firing at opponents locked in melee with the 
attacker’s allies. 

Mounted Combat 

Characters fighting from horseback (or other strange beasts) 
have certain advantages and disadvantages in combat, as 
described below. 

Mounts aren’t dealt Action Cards—they act with their riders. 
Animals specifically noted as being trained to fight (such as 
warhorses) may attack any threat to their front during their 
riders’ action. Untrained horses do not fight unless riderless, 
and even then usually only if cornered. 

. 
Horsemanship: Characters who wish to fight from 
horseback must use the lowest of their Fighting or Riding 
skills. This makes it important for cavalrymen to actually be 
able to ride well! 
73 

. 
Collisions: If a mounted character runs into something 
solid—such as a wall—both he and the mount suffer Collision 
Damage as explained in the Vehicle Rules on page 98. 
. 
Running: Riders suffer the usual running penalty (–2) to 
attacks if the animal runs. 
. 
Falling: Anytime a character is Shaken or suffers a wound 
while on horseback he must make a Riding roll to stay horsed. 
If he fails, he falls. If the horse is moving, the rider suffers 2d6 
damage (he’s merely Fatigued for the rest of the fight if the 
horse was still). 
. 
Firing on Mounted Targets: Shots directed at mounted 
characters use the Innocent Bystander rules to see if the 
horse was hit. Of course, an attacker can always aim for the 
horse instead. 
. 
Charging: A rider on a charging horse adds +4 to 
his damage roll with a successful Fighting attack. To be 
considered charging, the rider must have moved at least 6” 
or more in a relatively straight line towards his foe. 
. 
Setting Weapons: A weapon with a Reach of 1 or greater 
can be “set” against a cavalry attack. To do so, the attacker 
must be on Hold when he is attacked by a charging mount 
(see above). 

If so, he rolls to interrupt as usual, but each combatant adds 
+2 to his Agility roll for each point of his weapon’s reach. The 
winner attacks first, and adds the +4 charge bonus to his 
damage; the loser gains no bonus. 

. 
Wounded Mounts: When an animal is Shaken or 
wounded, it rears or bucks. A rider must make a Riding roll 
to stay mounted, or suffer the consequences of falling (see 
above). Mounts which aren’t trained in fighting flee in a random 
direction when Shaken, taking their riders with them. 
Nonlethal Damage

A character who wants to beat someone up without killing 
them can choose to do nonlethal damage. This requires the 
attacker use only his fists or a blunt weapon of some sort. 
Edged weapons may be used if they have a flat side, but this 
subtracts –1 from the attacker’s Fighting rolls. 

Nonlethal damage causes wounds as usual, but if a 
character is rendered Incapacitated he’s knocked out for 1d6 
hours instead.

Nonlethal wounds are otherwise treated exactly as lethal 
wounds. This means it’s much easier to render an Extra 
unconscious than a Wild Card. This is intentional, and should 
work well for most genres where heroes can take multiple 
punches before going down for the count, but most “mooks” 
go out with one or two good punches. 

Example: Virginia is whacked on the head by a 
cultist. The villain gets lucky and does 4 wounds to 

our heroine. Virginia rolls her Vigor and gets a failure. 

Because he was doing nonlethal damage, Virginia is 

simply knocked out for 1d6 hours. 

Obstacles 

Sometimes characters have sufficient power to attack their 
foes through obstacles. (See the Breaking Things section to 
actually destroy intervening obstacles.) To do so, first decide 
if the attack hits. If it misses, there’s no additional effect other 
than a small hole in the intervening obstacle. 

If the attack would have hit without the cover modifier, the 
round is on target but the obstacle acts as armor for the 
target behind it. In the table below are the Armor bonuses 
for some obstacles commonly used as cover. This is added 
directly to the target’s Toughness, including any actual armor 
he’s wearing in the affected location. Subtract the weapon’s 
Armor Piercing value from the total protection offered—not 
from both the obstacle and armor actually worn by the target. 

Example: A soldier blasts an Axis abomination 

hiding behind a stone wall (Armor +10) with a bazooka. 

The bazooka ignores 9 points of Armor, so the wall 

only provides 1 point of protection. 

Obstacle Toughness 

Armor Obstacle 

+1 Glass, leather

+2 Plate glass window, shield 

+3 Modern interior wall, sheet metal, car door

+4 Oak door, thick sheet metal 

+6 Cinder block wall 

+8 Brick wall 

+10 Stone wall, bulletproof glass 

Off-Hand Attacks 

Characters are assumed to be right-handed unless the 
player decides otherwise. Actions that require precise eye-
hand coordination, such as Fighting or Shooting, suffer a –2 
penalty when done with the off-hand. 

Prone 

Smart heroes lie down when lead starts flying. They move, 
shoot, and then get prone behind cover before their action is 
over, forcing attackers to go on Hold to attack them. Prone 
gives them Medium Cover against most attacks. Ranged 
attacks within 3” ignore the modifier since the target is just 
as exposed as if he were standing next to these characters. 

If a prone defender is caught in melee, his Parry is reduced 
by 2 and he must subtract 2 from his Fighting rolls. Getting 
up from prone costs 2” of movement. 

Push 

Sometimes characters may want to push a foe in hopes 
of knocking him out of position, prone, or even into a deadly 
hazard. This is called a Push. 

To push a foe, the attacker and the target make opposed 
Strength rolls. If successful, the attacker has three choices. 
He can: 

• 
Bash: Push the target 1” for a success and 2” on 
a raise on the Strength roll. If the defender hits an 
obstacle, he suffers 1d6 damage for every 1” he would 
have moved. 
• 
Shield Bash: If the attacker has a shield, he can push 
the attacker as above, but also causes Str damage. 
Add +1 to the damage for a small shield, +2 for a 
medium shield, and +3 for a large shield. 
• 
Knock Prone: The defender is knocked prone. 
. 
Running: If the attacker ran at least 3” before the push, 
he adds +2 to his roll. 
. 
Hazards: The Game Master must determine results from 
any other obstacles or hazards, such as a cliff edge, wall of 
fire, etc. 
Ranged Weapons in Close Combat

No ranged weapon larger than a pistol may be fired at 
adjacent foes engaged in melee. Larger weapons may be 
used as clubs, however. Pistols can be fired in close combat, 
but since the defender is actively fighting back, the TN for the 
Shooting roll is his Parry rather than the standard TN of 4. 

That means it’s harder to hit someone who’s wrestling with 
your character in melee than someone a few feet further away 
who isn’t actively wrestling with your hero. 

Rapid Attack

Sometimes an outnumbered fighter needs to sacrifice skill 
for blind luck. A rapid attack is a wild swing of the blade or a 
hasty spray of shots that favors fortune over expertise. Both 
the melee and ranged version inflict a –2 penalty to Parry. 

In melee, the warrior can make up to three attacks as a 
single action. Roll a Fighting die for each, and subtract –4 for 
the totals (Wild Cards get a Wild Die as usual). 

Ranged attackers with a semi-automatic weapon or revolver 
may fire up to six shots at a –4 penalty to each. Roll a Shooting 
die for each shot (along with the Wild Die if the attacker is a 
Wild Card). Single action revolvers refer to this maneuver as 
“fanning the hammer,” and it requires two hands to perform. 

Rapid attack cannot be combined with any other effect that 
allows attacking multiple foes in one action (Sweep, Frenzy, 
Autofire, Two Weapons, etc.), nor may it be used with a Double 
Tap or Three Round Burst. 

The rapid attack must be taken all at once but the warrior 
can assign his skill dice to multiple targets if he chooses. 

Tests of Will 

Intimidation and Taunt allow a character to make a “Test 
of Wills” attack against an opponent. In combat situations 
or during competitive miniature battles, Tests of Will have 
objective effects, as seen below. More subjective effects are 
determined by the Game Master in roleplaying situations. 

75 

To make a Test of Wills, the character makes an opposed 
roll against his chosen target. The defender uses Smarts to 
resist Taunt, and Spirit to resist Intimidation. 

The Game Master should modify both character’s rolls 
depending on the situation. Waving a gun in someone’s face 
isn’t polite, but it’s definitely worth a +2 bonus to Intimidation, 
for example (unless the target has an even bigger gun!). 

A success means the attacker gets a +2 bonus to his next 
action against the defender during this combat. A raise on 
the roll gives the attacker the bonus and makes the defender 
Shaken as well. This can be a great setup for an attack, a 
trick, or even a second Test of Wills if the first one didn’t get 
a Shaken result. 

Test of Wills Table 

“Attack” Skill 
Taunt vs. 
Resisted By… 
Smarts 
Intimidation vs. Spirit 

Example: Buck Savage tries to Taunt a crocodile 
cultist by flipping his machete and grinning like a 
hyena. He rolls his Taunt and beats the warrior’s 
Smarts with a raise. The cultist is Shaken and Buck 
adds +2 to his next action against the spearman. 

Touch Attack 

A character who simply wants to touch a foe (usually to 
deliver a magical effect of some kind) may add +2 to his 
Fighting roll. 

Tricks 

Heroes often attempt fancy maneuvers or clever tricks to 
distract their foes and set them up for deadly follow-up attacks. 
This might include throwing sand in an opponent’s eyes, 
ducking between a tall foe’s legs to stab him in the back, and 
so on. Tricks do not include weapon feints—those are already 
“assumed” in a character’s Fighting and Parry scores. 

To perform the trick, the player must first describe exactly 
what his character is doing. Next he makes an opposed Agility 
or Smarts roll against his foe. The GM must determine which 
is more appropriate based on the player’s description of the 
maneuver. 

If the character is successful, his opponent is distracted and 
suffers –2 to his Parry until his next action. With a raise, the 
foe is distracted and Shaken as well. 

These penalties do not stack. Tricking a foe twice has no 
additional effect. 

Example: Buck is backed into a corner by a very 
large and dangerous thug. Our hero pulls the oldest 
trick in the book. He says “Hi Virginia!” and pretends 
to smile at someone behind his less-than-brilliant foe. 
He and the thug both make Smarts rolls, and Buck 
wins with a raise. The thug swirls about, expecting an 
attack from behind, and is momentarily Shaken. The 
unfortunate goon also suffers –2 to his Parry until his 
next action, giving Buck time for a quick rabbit punch 
that just might put the big fellow down. 


Two Weapons

A character may attack with a weapon in each hand if he 
desires. This works just like any other multi-action, and inflicts 
a –2 penalty to each attack. (Note that the Two-Fisted Edge 
negates the multi-action penalty when attacking with two 
weapons.) 

Unless your hero has the Ambidextrous Edge, subtract 
another 2 points from the off-handed attack (see Off-Hand 
Attacks). A hero with the Frenzy Edge adds the additional die 
with either melee attack of his choice. 

Example: A warrior is backed into a corner by a pack 
of ravenous dire wolves. He has two short swords but 
isn’t Ambidextrous. The first roll suffers a –2 penalty 
(for using two weapons), and the second suffers a –4 
penalty (the multi-action penalty for two weapons plus 
the off-hand penalty). He makes his Fighting roll twice, 
and gets his Wild Die with each roll. 

Unarmed Defender 

If one character has a melee weapon and his foe doesn’t, 
the opponent is considered unarmed and is very likely in a 
world of hurt. Since he can only dodge and evade rather than 
parry, any armed attacker trying to hit him may add +2 to his 
Fighting roll. Nearly all animals and monsters are considered 
armed due to natural weapons such as claws and teeth. 

Unstable Platform 

A character attempting to fire a ranged attack from the back 
of a horse or other mount, a moving vehicle, or other “unstable 
platform” suffers –2 to his Shooting roll. 

Wild Attack 

Sometimes a desperate character may want to throw caution 
to the wind and attack with everything he’s got. This is called 
a “wild attack,” and can be devastating if used correctly. If 
used recklessly, it can quickly get even a veteran character 
slaughtered. 

Performing a wild attack adds +2 to the character’s Fighting 
attack and resulting damage roll, but his Parry is reduced by 
2 until his next action. 

Wild attacks can be used with multiple attacks, such as from 
the Frenzy or Sweep Edges, or with two weapons. 

Withdrawing From Close Combat

Inevitably, your hero will decide discretion is the better part of 
valor. Whenever a character retreats from melee, all adjacent 
non-Shaken opponents get an immediate free attack (but only 
one—no Frenzy or other Edges apply unless they specifically 
say otherwise). 

A character may take the Defend option (+2 Parry) while 
retreating from combat, but won’t be able to perform other 
actions that round besides movement and still suffers the 
free attack. 

Example: Inspector Mars is attacked by three cultists 
in melee. He decides to run for it, giving each cultist 

a free Fighting roll against him. Mars wisely uses the 

Defend maneuver as well to increase his Parry by +2 

until he can get away.

Healing 
The Healing skill can be used to treat any wound suffered 
within the last hour. Each attempt takes 10 minutes. 

A character may only attempt to heal fresh wounds on 
a given patient once within the hour they were sustained. 
A different character may attempt a Healing roll, but once 
attempted, that healer has done all he can for that particular 
patient. 

A success on a Healing roll removes one wound, and a raise 
removes two. Further raises have no effect. 

. Modifiers: The healer must subtract the patient’s wound 
levels from his skill roll. A wounded character trying to heal 
his own injuries suffers from both effects (his wounds plus the 
wound penalty to the Healing roll). 
Healing requires some basic supplies such as bandages and 
reasonably clean water. If these aren’t available, the healer 
suffers a –2 penalty to his roll. 

. The Golden Hour: After one hour, only natural healing or 
the greater healing power can help. 
. Incapacitated Patients: If a victim is Incapacitated the 
healer must first make a Healing roll to remove that state, 
He may then attempt further Healing rolls to remove actual 
wounds. 
Design Note - The Golden Hour 
In the real world, paramedics have a term called “the 
Golden Hour.” Patients who survive their initial trauma 

have about an hour to survive most life-threatening 

injuries. If they receive medical attention during that 
time, they can generally be saved. The longer the wait, 
however, the more likely the wounds are to be fatal. 

In Savage Worlds, we extend this concept to healing 
in general. A medic who can treat a wound within the 
first hour can typically negate some of its ill effects. 
Besides reflecting the real-world concept, it also 

provides good game balance and drama. If the party 
could simply retry Healing rolls over and over at any 

time, their group would never experience the drama 

of being beaten up by the bad guys, then deciding 

whether or not to seek shelter and rest up, or 
striving on despite their gruesome wounds. 

Natural Healing 

Every five days, wounded or 
Incapacitated characters may make 
Vigor rolls. Wild Cards remove one wound 
level (or their Incapacitated status) with 
a success, or improve two steps with a 
raise. A critical failure on a natural healing 
roll increases a Wild Card’s wound level by 
one. If the hero already has three 
wounds he becomes Incapacitated. 
Extras lose their Incapacitated status 
with a success and expire if they roll 
a 1 on their Vigor die. 

Subtract wound penalties from these rolls as usual, as well 
as any of the modifiers below. These are cumulative, so rough 
traveling in intense cold with one wound is a total penalty of 
–5, for example. 

Medical attention means that someone with the Healing skill 
is actively checking the patient’s wounds, changing dressings, 
giving what medicines are available, and generally looking 
after the patient’s well-being. 


Natural Healing Modifiers 

Modifier Condition 

–2 Rough traveling 

–2 No medical attention 

–2 Poor environmental conditions, such as 

intense cold, heat, or rain 

— Medical attention (1940 or earlier) 
+1 Medical attention (1941 or better) 
+2 Medical attention (2010 and beyond) 
Aftermath 

It’s often important to know what happens to Extras who 
were Incapacitated during a fight. This creates interesting 
choices for the players after battle as they must decide what 
to do with their wounded companions and living captives. Do 
they leave their men behind? Do they slaughter their foes? 
These situations should present your group with chances to 
roleplay their characters, and challenges to their overall plans 
as they have to deal with prisoners or walking wounded. 

After a fight, the players make Vigor rolls for all of their 
wounded allies and the GM rolls for wounded foes. With a 
success, the Extra is alive but Incapacitated (failure indicates 
death). With a raise, the wounds were only superficial and 
the character may function normally. 

. Walking Wounded: If it becomes important to know which 
Incapacitated characters can walk and which cannot, make 
a second Vigor roll for each. Those who make it are “walking 
wounded”—they may shamble slowly but still cannot fight or 
perform other useful actions. 
Those who don’t make the roll can be 
moved but risk aggravating their injuries. 
They must make another Vigor roll for 
each and every hour of movement. Should 
they fail, they begin to die. They may be 
stabilized with a Healing roll at –2, but any 
further movement will no doubt be fatal. 


78 

Extended Combat Example 
The heroes are two soldiers in a Weird Wars: Vietnam campaign—Lt. Griffith 
and Private Daniels. While on patrol, they’re attacked by a pack of ravenous 
walking dead. The Game Master goes to combat rounds and deals out Action 
Cards. He draws a Ten of Clubs for the zombies. Lt. Griffith draws a Jack 
of Spades. Private Daniels has the Quick Edge and draws a Two of Clubs. 
That’s too low so he draws again and gets a Joker! 

Private Dan’– Joker 

Dan whips out a grenade and places the Medium Burst Template directly 
over three of the zombies. They’re in Short Range so there are no penalties 
to the roll. The Joker gives him a +2 and his Throwing is d6. He rolls a 6, 
which is an Ace. He rolls again and gets a 4. That’s 6+4+2 for the Joker, 
or 12. He hits with a raise over the standard TN of 4. Grenades cause 3d6 
damage, and 4d6 with the raise. After Acing and adding all the dice together, 
he gets a 23. That’s far more than a raise over the zombies’ Toughness 7, 
so that’s a wound to each. They’re Extras so that’s all they can take and all 
three are wiped out. 

Lt. Griffith – Jack of Spades

Lt. Griffith now fires full-auto and decides to split his shots between zombies 
G, F, and E. His Shooting is d6 and he has an M-16. He doesn’t have the 
Rock n’ Roll Edge so his shots are at –2. His TN at Short Range is 4, so with 
the –2 he needs to roll 6 or better on each of his dice. 

The first two dice are misses. The third die is an Ace (6) so he rolls again 
and gets another Ace (6). He rolls once more and gets a 4 for a total of 16, 
minus two for full-auto is 14. A hit with a raise on Zombie E. The Lt.’s Wild Die also Aces and winds up with a grand total of 6. He chooses 
to use that on Zombie F. 

Lt. Griffith rolls the hit on Zombie F first. Damage on an M-16 is 2d8. He rolls the dice together and gets a total of 9. That exceeds the 
zombie’s Toughness of 7 but isn’t a raise, so it’s Shaken. 

Now Lt. Griffith rolls the hit with the raise on Zombie E. The damage is 2d8 plus a d6 for the raise. Griffith rolls a 4, an 8, and a 6. He 
rolls both the 8 and the 6 again since those are both Aces and gets a 2 on both dice. That’s (4+8+6+2+2=) 20! That’s a raise over the 
zombie’s Toughness so it’s blasted to pieces. 

The Zombies — Ten of Clubs 

Now the zombies go. Zombie F is Shaken and makes a Spirit roll at +2 for being undead. It rolls a 1 for a total of 3 so it’s unShaken but 
cannot act. It can move, however, so it shambles into contact with Private Dan. 

Zombies D and G also move into contact with Private Dan. Since Zombie F is in contact, this gives them +2 on their Fighting rolls due to 
the Gang Up Bonus (page 73). Zombie D misses but G gets a total of 6 and Dan’s Parry is 5, so that’s a hit. It does Str+d4 with its claws. 
It’s Strength is a d6, so the GM rolls a d6+d4 and gets a 5. Dan’s Toughness is 5, so he’s Shaken. 

Round Two 

The GM shuffles the deck because Dan got a Joker, then deals new Action Cards. Lt. Griffith gets a lousy Two of Clubs. The zombies 
get an Ace of Diamonds, and Dan gets an Ace of Clubs. Diamonds go before Clubs, so the zombies act first. 

Zombies — Ace of Diamonds 

Zombie F succeeds on its Spirit roll to recover from Shaken so all the zombies can now attack. They give each other +2 to their Fighting 
rolls since they’re ganging up on the private. Zombie D misses with a 1. Zombie G gets a 5, +2 for ganging up for a total of 7. That’s regular 
damage of Str+d4, and it gets a total of 6. Since Dan is already Shaken, that causes a wound and he remains Shaken. 

Zombie F now gets really lucky. It hits with a raise and rolls 15 damage. Every raise over Dan’s Toughness is a wound, so that’s two 
wounds. He already has one from Zombie G, so that brings him to three wounds total. He’s already Shaken so that doesn’t change. 

Private Dan — Ace of Clubs 

Dan fails his Spirit roll and can’t act. He doesn’t move out of combat either or the zombies will get free attacks on him (page 76). 

Lt. Griffith — Two of Clubs 

It’s all up to Lt. Griffith. He fires on full-auto again and puts a die into each zombie. He misses Zombie D but hits with a raise on Zombie 
G—it goes down with a damage total of 13 (a raise over its Toughness). 

Unfortunately, the shot at Zombie F comes up a 2. The Innocent Bystander rules kick in (page 73) and Private Dan is hit for 2d8 damage! 
The Lt. grimaces, rolls, and causes 12 damage. Dan is already at 3 wounds and this causes more, so he’s Incapacitated. He makes a 
Vigor roll at –3 for his wounds and gets a total of 2. He rolls on the Injury Table and is Bleeding Out (page 69). He’ll have to make Vigor 
rolls each round to keep from dying unless Lt. Griffith can finish the zombies and heal him. 

But the GM asks Lt. Griffith to make a Fear check as he sees his trooper fall to the gruesome monsters. He fails. 

The last thing Private Dan sees is his commanding officer run screaming into the night. 

War is Hell.

Chapter Four: 
Situational Rules 
The following chapter contains rules you need only in 
particular situations—such as handling large groups of allies, 
chases, or dealing with hazards such as fire, drowning, or 
radiation. 

If this is your first time through the book, skim over the 
various sections so you know what’s in here, then come back 
and check them out in detail when you need them. 

Allies: Whether they’re sturdy men-at-arms, a hardy pirate 
crew, or soldiers under the heroes’ command, Allies are often 
a big part of Savage Worlds. Here you’ll find statistics for 
common henchmen, how to use them, and how to increase 
the experience of those who survive your warriors’ adventures. 

Chases: Fast-paced chases between hunter and prey are 
the subject of this section. Run anything from cat-and-mouse 
car chases through busy cities to massive dogfights with this 
simple system. For those who played previous versions of 
Savage Worlds, this is all new and greatly simplified. 

Dramatic Tasks: Defusing a bomb, performing an ancient 
ritual, or hacking a computer are all Dramatic Tasks. These 
rules turn what would otherwise be simple skill rolls into a 
tense and exciting encounter. 

Fear: This is the section to turn to when your hero faces 
Things Man Was Not Meant to Know. Fear tests and the grim 
consequences of failing them are found within. 

Hazards: Hazards include the rules for Fatigue, plus Bumps 
and Bruises, Cold, Disease, Drowning, Falling, Fire, Heat, 
Hunger, Poison, Radiation, Sleep, and Thirst. 

Interludes: Books, movies, and real life provide heroes with 
many opportunities to share something of their personality or 
their past with their companions. This often gets overlooked 

in roleplaying games where the narrative is focused on 
action and mysteries. Interludes address this by giving some 
form and function to small talk, and rewarding those players 
who get into character and roleplay a dramatic tale of their 
adventurer’s backstory. 

Mass Battles: Many Savage Settings feature massive wars, 
bloody battles, and terrible conflicts. This system gives the 
Game Master and the player characters a way to game out 
any size battle quickly and dramatically. It also provides a 
way for the heroes to get in on the action and influence the 
final results. 

Setting Rules: The standard rules are a foundation for your 
campaign. Setting Rules help one world stand out from 
another. Here you’ll find rules like Blood & Guts—which allows 
players to spend Bennies on damage rolls! Or No Power 
Points, which trades the Power Point system for a faster but 
riskier method. These Setting Rules are referenced in the 
One Sheet adventures at the end of this book at the start of 
each tale. 

Social Conflicts: How do you handle a court case? What do 
you do if your heroes petition the king for aid—while a rival 
actively works against them? This section presents a simple 
and dramatic system for social conflicts based on Persuasion 
and how successful—or unsuccessful—the petitioner is. 

Travel: Here you’ll find guidelines for travel times and how to 
stage encounters along the way. 

Vehicles: Vehicular battles are a staple of post-apocalyptic 
fiction, World War II adventures, and other technological 
settings. This section covers how to move vehicles on the 
table-top, handle attacks between them, and what happens 
when they go out of control.

Allies 


Allies play a big part in many Savage Worlds games. They 
serve as troops under your hero’s command in Weird War 
games, loyal retainers in fantasy settings, or fellow fighters 
in glorious rebellions against oppression. 

Keeping up with allies in Savage Worlds is simple. Just 
download the Ally Sheet from our website and fill in the blanks. 

Allied Personalities 

You can add a little flavor to your allies by rolling on the 
Personality Table. Jot down the keyword on the Ally Sheet so 
that you and your Game Master can have a little insight into 
each particular ally’s character. 

For the most part, you should consider these general 
impressions with no particular game effect. What they can do 
is help both the players and the GM decide just how an ally 
might react in a given situation. In a Weird War Two game, 
for instance, a player with a young lieutenant character could 
look over his list and choose the “Observant” character to pull 
guard duty. If he has to go with the “Lazy” soldier for some 
reason, there’s a good chance the GM will rule he falls asleep 
sometime during his watch. 


Personality Table 

d20 Personality d20 Personality 
1 Young 11 Crude 
2 Cruel 12 Agile 
3 Old 13 Observant 
4 Happy 14 Clueless 
5 Experienced 15 Mysterious 
6 Gung Ho 16 Creative 
7 Lazy 17 Artistic 
8 Sneaky 18 Fearless 
9 Bright 19 Cowardly 
10 Dumb 20 Heroic 

Allies & Experience

Allies who take part in battle with their more heroic 
employers gain experience as well—but not as quickly 
as player characters. Don’t keep track of their experience 
points—just roll randomly to see if they’ve “leveled.” 

At the end of a game session in which the allies had a 
significant role (usually by participating in combat), roll a d6 for 
each group of identical troops. On a roll of 5-6, the survivors 
level up just like player characters and get one Advance. On 
a failure, they don’t. 

Ammo 

Keeping track of ammo for all your firearm-bearing allies can 
be a real pain. Here’s an easy and dramatic way to handle 
this problem. 

The ammo level of each group of allied Extras starts at Very 
High, High (the usual level), Low, or Out, as determined by 
the GM. A dot for each of these ammunition states can be 
found on the Ally Sheet. 

After each fight, the ammo drops a level (unless the GM feels 
the allies didn’t really use much in that scene). In combat, if 
the allies are dealt a Two, their ammo level drops a level after 
that round. This makes for dramatic situations and realistic 
logistical problems while eliminating a major bookkeeping 
chore. 

Typical Allies 

Here are a few typical soldier archetypes you might use for 
your own Savage Worlds games. Fill in any additional skills 
or Edges as you see fit. A group of rangers, for example, 
should have the Tracking skill, while cavalrymen should have 
the Riding skill, and so on.

Chases 
The Vehicle Rules on page 98 handle fast-paced action on 
the table-top. This is impractical for chases that take place 
over longer distances such as city streets or the open ocean, 
so use the Chase rules instead. It’s built for situations when the 
heroes must catch someone or something—or escape from it! 

Chase Length

First determine the length of the Chase: 

• 
Standard:Five rounds, used for most chases and usually 
simulates less than a minute of action per turn. 
• 
Extended: 
10 rounds, used for long pursuits such 
as those that take place between ships, and may be 
measured in minutes, hours, or even days. 
• 
Dogfight: 
The “chase” is actually a battle with highly 
mobile participants. It ends only when one side or the 
other withdraws or accomplishes its objectives. 
At the end of the last round, any prey who haven’t been 
otherwise stopped or captured escape and the pursuit ends. 

Chase Cards 

Rather than dealing everyone an Action Card as usual, 
have everyone roll the appropriate “maneuvering Trait” as 
listed below: 

• 
Agility: Foot chase 
• 
Boating: Watercraft 
• 
Driving: Vehicular chase 
• 
Piloting: Air or spacecraft 
• 
Riding: Mounted animals 
Participants draw a card for each success and raise on the 
maneuvering Trait roll, and keep one (usually the highest) as 
their Action Card. This determines not only their initiative but 
how well they managed to “maneuver” that particular round. 

Characters who don’t score at least a single success remain 
in the chase but get no Action Card that round. 

Making a maneuvering Trait roll does not count as an action. 

. 
Advantage: A character with a higher card than a foe is 
said to have “advantage” over him. This is abstract so it may 
mean the character is ahead, behind, or even parallel to his 
foe. The important thing is that he has somehow maneuvered 
in such a way as to gain a superior position, and can bring his 
weapons to bear (if he has any and is inclined to use them). 
See Attacks for further information on using the Advantage. 

. 
Speed: 
A character may add +2 to his roll if he or his 
vehicle has a higher top speed than the fastest opponent; or 
+4 if his top speed is twice as fast as his opponent’s. (Use 
Pace plus the character’s maximum possible running value 
if on foot or mounted.) 
. 
Edges: Level Headed and the Quick Edge don’t apply to 
maneuvering Trait rolls in Chases. 
. 
Terrain: If the Chase takes place primarily over difficult 
terrain, the GM should inflict a –2 penalty to all participants’ 
Trait rolls. 
. 
Climb: If an aircraft has a better Climb than his foe, he 
may also add +2 to the roll. 
. 
Passengers: Those riding in a vehicle have a choice. 
If they want to help the pilot or driver maneuver, and it 
makes sense in the context of the situation, they may make 
a cooperative maneuvering Trait roll. They draw no cards 
themselves but may add to the driver’s total as usual. 
The GM must decide what makes sense here. A passenger 
in a car might help navigate and make a cooperative roll—but 
a second passenger probably could not. On a sailing ship, 
the crew could make a group cooperative Boating roll to help 
the captain’s total. 

A passenger who makes a cooperative roll and wants to act 
would suffer the usual multi-action penalty. Passengers act on 
the driver’s Action Card. 

Attacks 

Characters act on their Action Card as usual, but since 
movement distance is abstract, the value of their Action Card 
determines any penalties to the roll due to Range and whether 
or not a melee attack is possible (in chases where it’s even 
a possibility). 

A character must have Advantage (an equal or higher Action 
Card) than his target to attack it. Acharacter with an Action Card 
of 7, for example, can only attack targets with Action Cards of 
7 or lower. A target with a higher card has outmaneuvered the 
attacker this round and cannot be targeted. 

. 
Groups: Extras roll as distinct groups and act on the 
same Action Card as usual. Divide each group’s attacks up 
proportionately among the opposition, losing attacks against 
heroes who have Advantage over them. For example, nine 
82 

wolves act on Seven and there are five player characters, 
so each hero is assigned two wolves. Any heroes who have 
higher cards than the wolves aren’t attacked that round. (This 
keeps characters with low cards from getting attacked by 
every enemy in the chase.) 

The opposite is not true. The player characters may always 
attack any foe or group of foes they have Advantage over. 

. 
Force: A driver with advantage may attempt to distract or 
even ram another vehicle in the chase as a normal action. 
The “trappings” may vary, but it is treated as an opposed 
maneuvering Trait roll modified by range. (Cooperative rolls 
may be allowed as usual.) On a success, the target suffers a 
–2 to his next maneuvering Trait roll. On a raise, the target is 
affected as if they hit an obstacle (see Complications). 
. 
Shaken Characters: If a character driving or piloting a 
vehicle is Shaken, he must make an Out of Control roll (see 
page 100). If the vehicle suffers damage, calculate it at half 
the vehicle’s Top Speed (see page 58). 
Characters who are Shaken at the start of a turn make 
their maneuvering Trait roll at –2. They attempt to become 
un-Shaken on their Action Card as usual. 

Complications

If a character’s Action Card is a Club, he faces a Complication 
of some sort on his action, as shown on the Complications 
Table. 

Players who rolled high enough to get multiple cards may 
choose to take a lower card to avoid a Complication. 

After the Complication is dealt with, the character may 
continue his action as usual—assuming he survived. 

Example: Knights & Bandits 

The heroes are a knight and a squire chasing three bandits 
through the woods. The knights are on horseback while the 
bandits are on foot. 

The three bandits make a group Agility roll (as they’re on 
foot) and get a 5. That’s one success so they draw a single 
card—a lowly Three. 

The squire’s Riding roll is 7 after adding +2 for being faster 
than the bandits. That’s one success so he draws one Action 
Card—a Jack of Clubs. Clubs signals a Complication, and the 
Jack indicates a Minor Obstacle (the GM decides he must 
avoid low-hanging branches). The Squire fails and is hit by 
the heavy limbs for Fatigue from Bumps and Bruises. 

The knight’s Riding total is 13. He draws three cards and 
chooses the best—a Joker. Since he’s ahead of the bandits 
and has a King or higher he can make a melee attack. He 
levels his lance and one less rogue plagues the King’s Road. 

Example: Road Warriors 

Abel drives a rig through the wasteland. Big Ben rides 
shotgun beside him, while Cale mans the turret on the back 
of the fuel tanker. Dala trails behind on a motorcycle. 

Chasing them are five gangers on motorbikes of their own. 
They make a group Driving roll of 7, draw a single card, and 
get an Eight. 

Abel makes a Driving roll and gets a 7. Big Ben decides 
to “navigate,” pointing out the debris in the road ahead, and 
makes a cooperative Driving roll. He’s successful and adds 
+2 to Abel’s total, making it 9. That’s a success and a raise, 
so Abel draws two cards and takes the highest—a Ten. He’s 
faster than the gangers, so they can’t attack him this round. 

Cale mans a crossbow turret on the back of the rig. He acts 
on Abel’s card of Ten, meaning he’s at Long Range (–4). He 
fires and a scores a kill—a ganger bites the radioactive dust. 

Dala is on a motorcycle and rolls a 4. She gets one card—a 
Four of Clubs. That’s a Major Obstacle Complication so she 
has to make a Driving roll at –2 or suffer a nasty wipeout. She 
barely makes it, the GM describing her skidding around an 
outcropping of rocks. 

The gangers are on Eight so they can only attack Dala (on 
a Four). Since there are five of them and four targets, the GM 
divides them up proportionately and decides only two are in 
position to attack. One ganger misses but the other scores 
a hit and wounds Dala, meaning she has to make another 
Driving roll or go Out of Control.

this isn’t possible, the runner gives out, the vehicle stops, etc. 
In any event, this participant is out of the chase. 
Major Obstacle: Objects of some sort get in the way. Make a 


Trait roll at –2 to avoid them or suffer damage appropriate to 
half top speed if in a vehicle, or a Fatigue level (Bumps and 
Bruises, see page 86) if on foot. 


Minor Obstacle: Objects of some sort get in the way. Make a 
Trait roll to avoid them or suffer damage appropriate to half top 
speed if in a vehicle, or a Fatigue level (Bumps and Bruises, 
see page 86) if on foot. 


Distraction: Something obscures the character’s vision or 
path. He cannot attack this round.

Example: Defusing a Bomb


Dramatic Tasks 

Heroes often find themselves in dramatic situations such as 
defusing a bomb or hacking a computer with a definite—and 
often deadly—time limit. The system below simulates these 
events and helps the Game Master throw some monkey 
wrenches and drama into what would otherwise be simple 
skill rolls. 

To start, first determine the skill to be used, such as 
Knowledge (Demolitions) to defuse a bomb, Knowledge 
(Occult) to complete a ritual, Knowledge (Electronics) to hack 
a computer, and so on. 

A standard Dramatic Task takes five “actions,” and requires 
the same number of successes (see below). Actions here may 
mean combat rounds or they may mean “attempts.” That’s 
entirely up to the Game Master and the situation. 

Performing a Dramatic Task

Each action, the hero draws an Action Card (even if not in 
combat) and acts on that card. Edges such as Level Headed 
or Quick work as usual. 

If the character nets five successes with the required Trait 
before time runs out, he’s accomplished his goal. It’s best to 
keep track of these successes with tokens of some sort so 
you don’t forget from round to round—and to give the player 
a visible measure of his success. 

If time runs out and the hero has not acquired five successes, 
the bomb detonates, the ritual fails, the computer shuts down, 
an alarm sounds, or the action otherwise fails. It’s up to the 
Game Master whether it may be attempted again, but since 
this was a Dramatic Task, it should normally have resulted 
in something very bad, or at least require an entirely new 
approach to attempt again. 

. 
Difficulty: 
Most Dramatic Tasks should have at least a 
–2 modifier. This reflects any safeguards on a bomb, the 
complexity of a ritual, security on a computer, etc. These 
are dramatic tasks, and by their very nature should be fairly 
difficult. 
. 
Cooperative Rolls: Other characters may assist the acting 
hero as usual, using the Cooperative Rolls rule on page 63. 
Complications

If the acting character’s Action Card is a Club, something 
has gone horribly wrong. He must make his roll this turn at 
–2 (in addition to any other modifiers). If failed, the worst 
possible resolution to the task occurs—the target escapes, 
the argument ends violently, the bomb explodes, or the battle 
is lost. 

Example: Ian “Haxxor” McTavish is trying to hack 
into a high-security mainframe at the corporate 

headquarters of Genesis, Inc. He draws a Three of 
Clubs and must make his Knowledge (Computers) 
roll this round at –2. If he fails, Genesis security 
system detects the intrusion. In this high-tech world 

of netrunners, the Game Master decides Ian doesn’t 

just fail—a powerful jolt of electricity is sent through 

the cables for 2d6 damage! 

The heroes are counter-terrorist operatives holding off 
waves of suicidal attackers while their demolitions expert, 
John, attempts to defuse a nuclear weapon. The Game Master 
decides the skill required is Knowledge (Demolitions), and all 
rolls suffer a –2 penalty due to the bomb’s inherent complexity. 

On the first round, the rest of the heroes attack the terrorists 
while John tries to defuse the bomb. His Action Card is a Six 
of Clubs—a Complication! The Game Master tells John the 
bomb was booby-trapped. John puts everything he has into 
the roll this turn and asks for help from one of his teammates 
who also has Knowledge (Demolitions). 

The companion makes a cooperative roll and adds +2 to 
John’s total. John starts by rolling a pathetic 3. He spends 
a Benny and rolls a 7. The –2 for the task makes it 5 and 
the –2 for the Complication makes it a 3. The companion’s 
cooperative roll brings it back up to 5—and saves the day! 

John now needs four more successes to defuse the bomb. 
This round he draws a Joker—breakthrough! “I’ve figured out 
the bomb-maker’s pattern,” he says confidently and gets a 
raise on his Knowledge (Demolitions) roll. Now he has three 
total successes. 

In the third round, John gets a Nine but fails his roll. He 
starts to sweat. 

Round four. John manages one success for a running total of 
four. “I don’t know if I’m going to make it!” he yells to the team. 
Soon after, John takes a wound from one of the terrorists’ 
rifles, leaving him Shaken and wounded! 

It’s the fifth round. The terrorists are closing in. John gets 
an Ace for his Action Card but fails his Spirit roll to recover 
from being Shaken! He spends his last Benny to eliminate the 
Shaken result, calls for help from his friend again, and makes 
his Knowledge (Demolitions) roll. If he makes it, the nuke is 
defused. If he doesn’t—it’s time to start a new campaign! 

Example: The Ritual 

The heroes are five investigators trying to stop an ancient 
and terrifying creature from entering our world. Four of the 
team battle the cultists who summoned it in their underground 
lair. The fifth, Professor Carter, begins to read a magical 
incantation he believes will close the gate and send the thing 
back to whatever hell it came from. 

In the first two rounds, the confident Dr. Carter gets four 
total successes. In the third, things go awry. He draws the 
unfortunate Seven of Clubs. The Game Master describes a 
sudden surge of tentacles and amorphous yet angular ooze 
seeping into our world. 

Professor Carter rolls at –2 and fails. “All hail our new 
masters,” says the doctor just before the Thing from another 
world devours him and begins a reign of terror that lasts a 
thousand years. 

Not every story has a happy ending. These are savage 
worlds, after all… 

84 

Fear 
Certain creatures and horrific scenes may challenge a 
character’s resolve and cause them to make a Fear check 
(a Spirit roll) when they see them. A success on the Spirit roll 
means the character manages to overcome the situation and 
carry on. A failed Fear roll depends on whether the cause of 
the roll was grotesque or terrifying in nature. 

• 
Fear/Nausea: If the scene was grotesque or horrific, 
such as a grisly discovery or learning a secret “Man 
Was Not Meant to Know,” the character is Shaken and 
must make a Vigor roll or suffer severe nausea/mental 
shock that causes a level of Fatigue for the remainder 
of the encounter. A natural 1 on the Spirit die (regardless 
of the Wild Die) causes the victim to roll on the Fright 
Table as well. 
• 
Terror: A terrifying trigger, such as a monstrous creature 
or unknowable evil, is much more intense, and can rattle 
even the most stout-hearted hero. Extras are typically 
Panicked. Wild Cards must roll on the Fright Table 
should they fail their Fear check. Roll 1d20 and add the 
monster’s Fear penalty, if any, to the roll (a –2 adds +2 
to the roll, for example). 
. 
Becoming Jaded: After encountering a particular type of 
creature, the character shouldn’t have to make Fear checks 
every time he sees another one in that particular scenario. If 
the party clears out a dungeon full of zombies, for example, 
they should only have to roll the first time they encounter 
them—not in every room. The Game Master might require a 
roll if the heroes encounter zombies in a particularly different 
or frightening situation, however, such as if they fall into a pit 
full of the ravenous creatures. 
Fright Table 
1d20* 
Effect 

1-4 
Adrenaline Surge: The hero’s “fight” 
response takes over. He adds +2 to all 
Trait and damage rolls on his next action. 

5-8 
Shaken: The character is Shaken. 

9-12 
Panicked: The character immediately 
moves his full Pace plus running die away 
from the danger and is Shaken. 

13-16 
Minor Phobia: The character gains 
a Minor Phobia Hindrance somehow 
associated with the trauma. 


17-18 
Major Phobia: The character gains a 
Major Phobia Hindrance. 


19-20 
The Mark of Fear: The hero is Shaken 
and also suffers some cosmetic physical 
alteration—a white streak forms in the 
hero’s hair, his eyes twitch constantly, or 
some other minor physical alteration. This 
reduces his Charisma by 1. 

21+ 
Heart Attack: The hero is so 
overwhelmed with fear that his heart 
stutters. He becomes Incapacitated and 
must make a Vigor roll at –2. If successful, 
he’s Shaken and can’t attempt to recover 
for 1d4 rounds. If he fails, he dies in 2d6 
rounds. A Healing roll at –4 saves the 
victim’s life, but he remains Incapacitated. 

*Add the creature’s Fear penalty as a positive 
number to this roll. 

85 

Hazards 
Heat, cold, hunger, thirst, lack of sleep, and other hazards 
can wear down even the hardiest heroes, sending them into a 
downward spiral that can lead to death if he can’t improve his 
situation. Drowning, fire, and falling are much more immediate 
dangers, while others are more insidious—such as poison 
and disease. 

On the following pages are the most common hazards, 
with details on when a character must roll, any important 
modifiers, and how one recovers from any effects he’s suffered 
from it. Use these hazards mostly for dramatic purposes. 
A quick trip to the outhouse through a blizzard isn’t worth 
keeping up with, but a long trek through the Mountains of 
Dread certainly is, especially if it heightens the drama and 
makes the party think about things they might otherwise 
ignore, such as shelter, warm clothing, or eating their mounts 
to stay alive. 

Fatigue

Some hazards cause direct damage, but most cause 
Fatigue—stress or weakness that makes a victim less effective 
and can eventually lead to Incapacitation or even death. 

A character who falls victim to Fatigue passes through 
several declining states before finally succumbing to his 
stress. Each of these states and the penalties they incur are 
described below. 

• 
Fatigued: The hero is tiring quickly. All of his Trait 
checks suffer a –1 modifier. If he suffers Fatigue again, 
he becomes Exhausted. 
• 
Exhausted: 
The hero is fading fast. He suffers –2 to all 
Trait rolls. If he suffers Fatigue again, he’s Incapacitated 
unless the hazard description says otherwise. 
• 
Incapacitated: The victim collapses and is Incapacitated. 
See Incapacitation Effects under each Hazard for what 
happens next. 
. 
Recovery: Recovering from Fatigue varies depending on 
its source. Severe hunger requires food, cold requires warmth, 
and so on. Exactly how Fatigue is relieved depends on how it 
was acquired. This is explained under each Hazard. 
. 
Multiple Hazards: It doesn’t matter what the source of 
Fatigue is. If a hero who’s already Exhausted from hunger then 
suffers a level of Fatigue from cold, he becomes Incapacitated. 
A character suffering from multiple sources of Fatigue must 
address both to recover. 
Bumps and Bruises 

Characters who suffer minor but troubling injuries, such 
as stumbling down a slope or running through a cavern in 
the dark, can suffer from Fatigue rather than suffering actual 
wounds. This is the hazard to use when characters should 
be beat up a bit but not truly wounded. 

When a character suffers injuries like these he must 
make a Vigor roll. Those who fail gain a Fatigue level from 
bumps, bruises, cuts, and scrapes. The Game Master may 
occasionally allow sure-footed characters to make Agility rolls 
to avoid this damage instead. Fatigue gained in this way can 
lead to Exhaustion, but not to being Incapacitated. 


86 

• 
Recovery: Fatigue levels from Bumps and Bruises 
automatically improve one step 24 hours after the original 
injuries were suffered. 
• 
Incapacitation Effects: None. A victim cannot be 
Incapacitated from Bumps and Bruises. 
Example: Two heroes race down a steep slope to 

escape the clutches of some angry crocodile cultists. 

The Game Master decides they trip and suffer Bumps 
and Bruises if they don’t make Agility rolls. The first 
succeeds but the second fails and suffers Fatigue for 
the next 24 hours. 

Cold 

Trudging through deep snow for hours on end, or facing 
biting, bitter winds, can dehydrate and fatigue a character as 
quickly as blazing deserts. Every four hours spent in weather 
below freezing (32° F), a character must make a Vigor roll. 
Failure means the victim gains a Fatigue level. Subtract 1 from 
the victim’s Vigor roll for every 20 degrees below freezing to 
a maximum of –3. 

The roll assumes the character is wearing warm clothing. 
If not, subtract 2 from the total. Modern winter gear adds 
+2, and advanced gear (arctic suits) add at least +4 or more 
depending on the setting. 

• 
Recovery: Warmth and shelter from the elements allows 
a hero to recover a Fatigue level every 30 minutes. 
• 
Incapacitation Effects: Make a Vigor roll every hour 
or perish. 
Disease 

Diseases cover a wide range of maladies, from long-term 
debilitating illnesses to those which might cause immediate 
spasms or death. To handle such a diverse range of diseases, 
we’ve broken them down into those most likely to come into 
play in a typical game or campaign session. If you’re trying 
to model a specific disease, you’ll want to adjust the rules to 
better reflect that illness’ symptoms. 

• 
Recovery: Unless the disease description says 
otherwise, it can only be treated with specific medicines or 
very powerful magic. If the proper medicine is available, 
all the victim’s ailments vanish in 2d6 days minus half his 
Vigor die type, to a minimum of one day. If not, healers 
can make the victim more comfortable but have no further 
effect on his condition. For magical healing, see page 114. 
• 
Incapacitation Effects: Typically death unless the text 
details a different result. 
Contracting Diseases

Diseases may be acquired in one of the following ways: 

• 
Airborne: The toxin is in the air. If a character is aware 
of the toxin he can hold his breath for a number of rounds 
equal to 2 plus his Vigor die, or half that if he wasn’t 
prepared. After that he must breathe and automatically 
contracts the disease. If the victim is surprised by the 
release of the disease (such as a creature with exploding 
spores), he must make a Smarts roll to hold his breath 
before the tainted air enters his lungs. 
• 
Touch: The victim must make a Vigor roll immediately on 
being touched. If successful, the disease didn’t manage 
to “take” and there is no effect. Failure means the disease 
takes immediate effect as described below. 
• 
Induction: The disease must enter the bloodstream, 
most typically by an animal’s bite, or a cut by an infected 
weapon. In these cases, if a victim is Shaken or wounded 
by such an attack, he must make a Vigor roll. If failed, 
he contracts the disease. If successful, the disease 
didn’t manage to get into the bloodstream and there is 
no further effect. 
Disease Types

• 
Long-Term Chronic, Majorly Debilitating: These 
diseases cause constant irritation and exhaustion and 

eventually end in death. Leprosy, untreated tuberculosis, 
and similar fatal diseases fall into this category. Victims 
have frequent spasms and coughing fits and so are 
always Exhausted. If they suffer an additional Fatigue 
level, they are Incapacitated but do not die. At the start 
of every game session, the character must make a Vigor 
roll. If his total is ever a 1 or less, he’s going to pass 
away before the end of that session. The Game Master 
is encouraged to let the hero go out with style if possible, 
but he will perish before the game ends this time. 

• 
Long-Term Chronic, Minorly Debilitating: This 
works exactly as above except the unfortunate hero is 
constantly Fatigued rather than Exhausted. Examples 
of this kind of disease include malaria, fantasy diseases 
such as the touch of certain undead, or living in a foreign 
and slightly toxic environment. 
• 
Short Term, Debilitating: These are extremely rare 
in the real world but are very appropriate for fantasy 
or science-fiction settings. They are typically acquired 
from the scratch of a creature or breathing air laden 
with toxins (see Airborne and Induction, above). A victim 
who fails his Vigor roll and contracts the disease suffers 
Fatigue and is Shaken as he begins to cough and wretch 
uncontrollably. Once he recovers from being Shaken 
he may act normally but the Fatigue level (and thus the 
disease) remains for 2d6 days while the sickness works 
itself out. 
• 
Short Term, Lethal: Even more rare are diseases that 
can kill in seconds. Treat this exactly as Lethal Poison 
(see Poison). If a character survives but suffers Fatigue 
from the poison, it lasts 2d6 hours. 
Drowning 

Water is deadly to those who aren’t prepared for it. Here are 

some standard water hazards and how often a character must 

make a Swimming roll, with each failure adding a Fatigue level. 

• 
A character with at least a d4 in Swimming does not have 
to roll when in calm water. 
• 
In rough water, all characters must make a Swimming 
roll every minute. 
• 
In white water, the hero is swept into eddies and 
whirlpools (hydraulics) and rolls every round. 
• 
A hero forced to tread water for long periods without a 
flotation device must roll once every hour. 
87 

. 
Modifiers: Subtract –2 from a hero’s Swimming rolls 
if he is trying to hold something up, including another 
character. Add 2 to the roll if he’s wearing a life vest. 
• 
Recovery: Once a character is out of the water, he 
recovers one Fatigue level every five minutes. 
• 
Incapacitation Effects: Death in a number of rounds 
equal to half the victim’s Vigor die. If someone can get 
to the victim within five minutes of “death,” he can be 
resuscitated with a Healing roll at –4. 
Falling 

Falling damage is 1d6+1 per 10 feet fallen (round up), to a 
maximum of 10d6+10. If you’re playing on the table-top, treat 
every 2” as 10’ for simplicity. 

. 
Snow: Particularly soft ground, such as deep snow, acts 
as a cushion. Every foot of soft snow reduces damage by 
one point. 
. 
Water: A fall into water reduces the number of dice rolled 
by half (rounded down), and an Agility roll means the character 
dives and takes no damage at all, though he is automatically 
Shaken if he dives from a height of greater than 50’. A fall over 
15” (30 yards) requires an Agility roll at –2 to avoid damage. 
Fire 


Even giants impervious to the puny weapons of swordslingers 
are often afraid of flame and fire. Roll the damage 
listed below when a character is first burned and at the 
beginning of each round until he is free of the flame. Only 
sealed, fireproof armor adds to a character’s Toughness when 
resisting the effects of fire. 

Fire Damage 
Damage Description 

+2 Burning weapon 
1d10 “Spot fire,” such as a burning arm or leg 
2d10 Flamethrower 
3d10 Lava 

. 
Spreading: Anytime something flammable is hit by fire, roll 
1d6. On a 6, the target catches fire. Very flammable targets, 
such as a scarecrow, catch fire on a 4-6. Volatile targets, such 
as a person soaked in gasoline, catch fire on anything but a 1. 
Each round after a victim catches fire (at the beginning of 
his action), roll as if checking to see if the victim catches fire 
again. If he does, the fire grows in intensity and does the 
damage listed above each round. 

. 
Smoke Inhalation: Fires in confined areas produce deadly 
smoke. Every round a character is in such an environment, he 
must make a Vigor roll. A wet cloth over the face adds +2 to 
the roll, and a gas mask negates the need for the roll entirely. 
If the roll is failed, the character gains a Fatigue level. 
Heat 

Intense heat, typically that over 90 degrees Fahrenheit, 
can cause heat exhaustion and heat stroke, both of which 
are very dangerous. The actual danger is from dehydration, 
so well-supplied and conscientious characters can greatly 
improve their chances in extreme heat simply by carrying a 
good amount of water and drinking frequently. 

When the temperature reaches 90 degrees or more, the 
GM should pay attention to how much water characters are 
able to drink. If they are able to drink at least four quarts of 
water a day, they may be tired and sunburned, but are in no 
immediate danger. 

If that amount of water isn’t available, characters must make 
Vigor rolls every four hours. Subtract two from the roll if the 
hero has half the water he needs, and subtract 4 if he has 
less than half. Failure means the character gains one level 
of Fatigue. 

• 
Subtract 1 from the roll for each additional 5 degrees 
above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. 
• 
Add +1 if the hero stops all physical activity. 
• 
Add +1 to the roll if the character has substantial shade. 
• 
Recovery: A victim who receives sufficient water 
recovers one Fatigue level every hour. 
• 
Incapacitation Effects: An Incapacitated character 
suffers heat stroke and may suffer brain damage. 
Make a Vigor roll. If the roll is failed, the victim’s Smarts 
and Strength decrease by one step permanently (to a 
minimum of d4). 
88 

Hunger 
Radiation 


Humans need approximately one pound of food every 24 
hours. If sufficient sustenance isn’t available, a character 
begins to suffer from severe hunger. 

Starting the first day after the meal was missed, the 
character must make a Vigor roll. Subtract 2 if the hero has 
less than half the required amount of food. Failure means the 
character gains a Fatigue level. 

After the first day, the character must roll for hunger every 
12 hours, and thirst every 6 hours. 

. 
The Survival Skill: A successful Survival roll each day 
provides enough food and water for one person, or enough 
for five with a raise. 
• 
Recovery: At least a pound of decent food allows a 
character to recover a Fatigue level every hour, or every 
12 hours if he reached Incapacitated. 
• 
Incapacitation Effects: A character Incapacitated by 
hunger dies 3d6 hours later. 
Poison 

Poisons can be delivered many ways. If ingested, its effects 
occur automatically. If a victim is Shaken or wounded by a 
bite or weapon coated in poison, he must make an immediate 
Vigor roll against the type of poison listed on the Poison Effects 
Table below. If the poison has a modifier associated with it 
(such as Venomous [–2]), the victim’s Vigor roll is modified 
appropriately. 

The Game Master must decide which category is appropriate 
based on the poison. Most real-world animals are Venomous 
with only a few falling in the Lethal category. Ghouls might 
have paralyzing poison in their claws, while spies might use 
Knockout poison in drinks or gases. 

Characters who suffer Paralysis or a Knockout are 
Incapacitated until they recover. 

. 
Treatment: To treat a poisoned victim, the healer can try 
a Healing roll minus the strength of the poison itself (found 
in the poison’s description). If successful, the victim’s life is 
saved and the poison no longer has any effect—paralyzed 
victims can move and those rendered unconscious wake. 
Each character may only attempt one Healing roll per 
incident to cure the poison, but another character with Healing 
may make a second attempt, and so on. 

• 
Recovery: Fatigue leves from poison recover in 24 hours. 
• 
Incapacitation: Characters Incapacitated by accrued 
Fatigue recover as above. Other effects from the table 
below are handle separately. 
Characters in a radioactive environment must make a Vigor 
roll every hour spent in low radiation, and every minute in high 
radiation. Each failure results in a Fatigue level. 

• 
Recovery: Fatigue from radiation fades at the rate of one 
level every 24 hours, or half that if the victim can shower 
or scrub away lingering dust and other contaminants. 
• 
Incapacitation Effects: The victim contracts radiation 
sickness, a Long-Term Chronic, Minorly Debilitating 
disease, as explained under Disease. 
Sleep 

Most people need a minimum of six hours sleep out of every 

24. A character who goes without this amount of sleep must 
make a Vigor roll at a cumulative –2 every 12 hours thereafter 
(maximum penalty of –6). A large amount of coffee, soda, or 
other stimulant adds +2 to the roll. 
• 
Recovery: Every four hours of restful sleep removes a 
level of Fatigue. 
• 
Incapacitation Effects: A character who suffers this 
much Fatigue simply falls into a deep sleep for 2d10 
hours. 
Thirst 

An average-sized man requires two quarts of water a day. 
This requirement is doubled in both very dry conditions (such 
as the desert) or areas of high humidity (the jungle) as the 
character perspires constantly and begins to dehydrate. 

If enough water isn’t available, the hero begins to suffer from 
dehydration. Starting the first day after the water runs out, he 
must make a Vigor roll. Subtract 2 if the hero has less than 
half the required amount. Failure means the character gains 
a Fatigue level. After the first day, the character must make 
the required Vigor roll every 6 hours. 

. 
The Survival Skill: A successful Survival roll each day 
provides enough water (and food) for one person, or enough 
for five with a raise. 
• 
Recovery: Two quarts of water allows a character to 
recover a Fatigue level every hour. 
• 
Incapacitation Effects: Death in 2d6 hours. 
Poison Effects Table 
Type Failure Success Raise 
Lethal Death in 2d6 rounds 1 wound and Exhaustion Exhaustion 
Venomous Death in 2d6 minutes 1 wound and Exhaustion Exhaustion 
Paralysis Paralyzed for 2d6 minutes Paralyzed for 2d6 rounds Fatigue 
Knockout Knocked out for 2d6 hours Knocked out for 2d6 minutes Fatigue

Interludes Interludes 
In most heroic tales, characters engage in small talk that 
reveals something about their past or further develops their 
personality. Such “Interludes” are rare in roleplaying games 
where we focus primarily on action and the next encounter. 

The system below formulizes these scenes and rewards 
players for roleplaying their character and revealing their 
backstory to the rest of the group. 

Running an Interlude

The Game Master should run an Interlude during natural 
down-time such as when healing up after a fight, performing 
research, or between legs of a long trip. 

To start, pick a player and have her draw a card. The Suit 
determines the general topic as shown on the Interlude Table 
below. Each entry requires the player to tell a story in the 
voice of her character. The tale should be substantial enough 
to take a few minutes and may draw in other characters’ 
participation as well. 

The next time the Game Master feels an Interlude is 
appropriate, he should pick a different player so that everyone 
has a chance to participate and reap the rewards. 

. 
Rewards: After a player completes her tale, award her a 
Benny or an Adventure Card—her choice. 
Interlude Table 

• 
Clubs—Tragedy: Describe a tale of tragedy or misfortune 
from your hero’s past, featuring one of his Hindrances 
if possible. If the teller has a dark secret of some kind, 
hint strongly at it, drop clues, or otherwise give the rest 
of the group a glimpse into your hero’s dark side during 
your narrative. 
• 
Spades—Victory: 
Tell the group about a great victory 
or personal triumph in your adventurer’s past. How did 
it affect him afterward? Was there a reward? 
• 
Hearts—Love: Speak fondly of the character’s greatest 
love—lost, found, or waiting on him back home. What 
is her name? Where does she live? Why is the traveler 
not with her now? 
• 
Diamonds—Desire: Tell a tale about something your 
hero wants (or already has). It might be a material 
possession, recognition, a political goal, or even a trip 
he wishes to take to some amazing destination. 
Example: Crossing Mars 

Colonel Green of the Martian 24th Highlanders, his guide 
Sanjay of the Gurkhas, Lady Emily, and big game hunter 
extraordinaire Sir John Hobbsworth cross the vast Martian 
desert. They face sandstorms, intense heat by day, and bone-
numbing cold at night. 

The Game Master decides to call for an Interlude after each 
encounter along the way. 

Colonel Green goes first and draws a Spade. He describes 
with great vigor his travails against the wild Martians at 
Zimkangaroon and the tense battle he fought there. “It’s how 
I got this injury,” he says as he points to his Lame leg. 

Later, after surviving a terrible sandstorm, Lady Emily draws 
a Heart. “I will withstand any trauma,” she begins, “if only it will 
help me discover what happened to my beloved Nathaniel, 
lost in the mountains I have asked you all to escort me to.” 
She then goes on about how she and Nathaniel met, traveled 
to Mars, and began a new life far away from the grime and 
corruption of New York City. 

A day later, the party is ambushed by Martian raiders. Sanjay 
draws the next card—a Diamond. “See this bandit blade?” 
he says proudly. “It is a poor substitute for my kukri, awarded 
ten years ago when I joined the regiment.” Sanjay goes on to 
describe his training and some of the terrible battles he fought 
in the 6th Gurkha regiment before volunteering for service on 
faraway Mars. 

Sir Hobbsworth is next, with a Club. “I have hunted every 
creature on earth. Now I’ve come to Mars to bag the biggest, 
most ferocious beast on all the known worlds—the crask. I’ll kill 
the thing and mount its head on my wall. And nothing will stop 
me.” Hobbsworth then hints that he hopes the monster slays 
him as he slays it—revealing his Death Wish and the chronic 
disease he picked up during the campaign in the process. 

91 

Mass Battles 
Truly savage worlds often feature wars with massive and 
bloody battles. The system below rewards players who not 
only take part in these battles, but are instrumental in gathering 
political support, recruiting troops, and deciding strategies 
that win them. 

These rules allow the Game Master to handle everything 
from a small warband holding a fort against an undead horde 
to full divisions of troops fighting a massive field battle or 
a planetary assault from a space-based invasion fleet. It’s 
abstract, but provides a narrative base for heroes to plan, get 
involved, and even become involved in the fight themselves. 

Setup

To start, give the larger or more powerful army 10 tokens. 
Give the opposing army a proportional number of tokens. If 
one army has 10,000 men, for example, and the other has 
7,000, give the smaller army seven tokens. 

The Game Master will need to adjust for special or elite 
troops, better equipment, and so on. It’s not important to 
count every point of armor and damage point—just get close 
enough to give a reasonable approximation of strength, adjust 
where needed, and trust in the dice and the player’s actions 
to handle the rest. 

Knowledge (Battle)

Once the odds are determined, both sides make opposed 
Knowledge (Battle) rolls, modified by any of the circumstances 
below: 

Battle Modifiers 

Modifier Circumstance 

+1 The side with more tokens adds +1 for every token 
it has more than the foe each round 

Artillery or Air Support 

+1 Light 
+2 Medium 
+3 Heavy 


Terrain 

–1 Foe has slight advantage 
–2 Foe has minor advantage 
–3 Foe has major advantage 


Battle Plan (GM’s Call—determined each round) 

+/–? The army gains a penalty or a bonus depending on 
the tactical decisions made by the leader each 
round. Springing a hidden flank attack, sending 
reserves to a crucial front, and so on, all add to 
the Battle roll. 

. Casualties: Each success and raise causes the other side 
to lose one token. Casualties are generally distributed evenly 
throughout the force. 

. Morale: Each round in which an army loses a token, its 
leader must check morale. This is a Spirit roll modified by 
the circumstances below. With a success, the army fights 
on and both sides make another Knowledge (Battle) roll as 
described above. 
Failure means the army is defeated but the troops conduct 
an orderly retreat. Make one more Battle Roll and then end 
the fight. (A leader may voluntarily choose this option as well.) 

On a result of 1 or less, the troops rout and the battle is 
over immediately. 

Morale Modifiers 
Mod Situation 

–1 For each token lost in battle so far 
+2 The army is made up predominantly (75% or more) 
of undead or other fearless drones 
+2 The army is within major fortifications, such as a 
fortress or prepared positions 
+2 The army cannot retreat 

Characters in Mass Battles 

The heroes of your campaign aren’t likely to sit idly by 
while war rages around them. Fighters may want to charge 
the gates, wizards unleash fireballs into the masses, and a 
gallant knight may ride his trusty warhorse directly into the 
enemy formations. 

Those who want to get involved can dramatically affect the 
results of the battle. Have each character make a Fighting, 
Shooting, or arcane skill roll (their choice) each action and 
consult the Character Results below. 

. Modifiers: Add or subtract the number of tokens difference 
between the heroes’ side and their opponent. If the enemy 
has 8 tokens and the heroes have 5, for example, the heroes 
must subtract –3 from their attack rolls. 
Also add +1 to the roll for each Rank a hero has above 
Novice to account for his various Edges and abilities that 
aren’t reflected in a straight skill roll. 

Character Battle Results 
• 
Failure: The hero is stopped by overwhelming numbers, 
an unfortunate tactical development, or bad fortune. He 
suffers 4d6 damage. 
• 
Success: The hero fights well and adds +1 to his side’s 
Battle Roll, though he suffers 3d6 damage. 
• 
Raise: The hero wreaks havoc, slaying enemy leaders 
and destroying important assets. He suffers 2d6 damage, 
but adds +2 to his side’s Battle Roll. 
• 
Two Raises: The warrior covers himself in glory! Scores 
of foes fall before him and his success inspires his allies 
to fight like demons. His efforts add +2 to his side’s Battle 
Roll and he emerges from the fight unscathed. 
. Ammo: If it’s important to track, each round a hero enters 
the fray and uses his Shooting or an arcane skill (such as 
Spellcasting), he expends some of his ammunition or Power 
Points. 
Arcane types use 2d6 Power Points per round. Characters 
with ranged weapons use 3d6 shots for ranged weapons 
(triple that for weapons that usually fire bursts or full-auto). If 
the hero winds up without any ammo or Power Points she’ll 
have to change tactics for the next round. 

92 

Battle Aftermath 


Example: The Invasion of Earth 


When one side routs, retreats, or runs out of tokens, the 
battle ends and casualties are removed. Some of the troops 
lost in the battle can be recovered as they regroup or receive 
first aid. 

If it’s important to know how things stand after the fight, roll 
1d6 for each token lost. The victor recovers a lost token on a 
roll of 4-6. The loser recovers a lost token on a roll of 5-6. A 
routed army recovers tokens only on a roll of 6. 

After the battle and once both sides have figured out how 
many tokens they lost, remove the actual casualties from 
their armies. The side that started with the larger force simply 
multiplies the number of tokens lost by 10%. Losing four 
tokens, for example, means the entire army suffered 40% 
casualties. The side with the smaller force must figure out what 
percentage of his men are left. If he started with 8 tokens and 
ends up with only 2, for example, he’s lost 75% of his force. 

Once you’ve figured the total percentage of casualties to 
your army, distribute the losses among specific units as evenly 
as possible. 

The insectoid Gorram Empire is conducting a planetary 
assault of Earth. The Gorram have 10 tokens that represent 
their massive invasion fleet and armored walkers with fiery 
death rays. Earth has all the world’s militaries at their disposal. 
Given the superiority of Gorram technology and greater 
numbers, the GM decides the Earth Defense Force (EDF) 
gets 8 tokens. 

Both sides have heavy artillery and air support (+3 to both 
sides), but there are no terrain advantages since it’s a worldwide 
battle. 

The Gorram Empire makes a Knowledge (Battle) roll and 
gets a 13. The player characters load up in stratospheric 
fighters and lend a hand. Collectively, they suffer some 
damage but also add a grand total of +3 to the roll. The EDF’s 
Knowledge (Battle) final total is 17—Earth wins by 4. That 
destroys two of the invaders’ tokens and 20% of their force. 

The Game Master describes the first few hours of the 
invasion and a spirited defense by earth’s militaries. The evil 
insectoids are dealt heavy losses, but are far from defeated, 
and the battle goes on. 

93 

Setting Rules 
There are many Savage Worlds with settings ranging from 
dark and gritty detective tales to cinematic epics to political 
thrillers. These rules provide a great framework for anything 
you want to do but adding the right setting rules really bring 
the world and the action to life. 

Blood & Guts 

Characters can spend Bennies on damage rolls! Use this 
rule when you really want to up the carnage. 

Born A Hero 

During character creation, heroes may ignore the Rank 
qualifications for Edges. They must still have any other 
requirements as usual. The usual rules for Rank requirements 
apply after the character is created. 

Critical Failures 

This rule works well for very dark or very humorous games. 
When a character rolls double 1’s on a Trait roll, he can’t spend 
a Benny—he’s stuck with the critical failure. 

Fanatics 

Use this rule in pulp-style games where villains are larger 
than life. When a Wild Card enemy character is hit by a 
successful attack, any of his henchmen, goons, or other allies 
jumps in front of his master and suffers the attack instead. 

Gritty Damage 

This variation on damage works well for settings such as 
gritty detective scenarios or “realistic” military adventures. It 
can be very lethal so use it cautiously. 

Treat Extras’ wounds normally. 

For Wild Cards, count wounds as usual and go through the 
normal steps for Incapacitation should he accumulate more 
than three wounds. 

In addition, every time the hero suffers a wound, roll on 
the Injury Table and apply the results immediately (but roll 
only once per incident regardless of how many wounds are 
actually caused). A hero who takes 2 wounds from an attack, 
for example, still only suffers one roll on the Injury Table. 

Injuries sustained in this way are cured when the wound 
is healed. (Injuries sustained via Incapacitation may be 
temporary or permanent as usual.) 

A Shaken character who’s Shaken a second time from a 
damaging attack receives a wound as usual but does not 
have to roll on the Injury Table. 

Example: Sergeant Trotter is a hero in Weird Wars. 

He takes a wound from a German sniper, doesn’t 
Soak it, and so has to roll on the Injury Table. He rolls 
a 10—Leg. The GM rolls a die and decides it’s the left 
leg. Trotter is now Lame. If he takes another wound 

to that leg, he’d have the One Leg Hindrance. Further 

wounds to the same leg add to his wound total as usual 

but have no further effect as there’s nothing beyond 

the One Leg Hindrance. 

Later, the unfortunate Sarge takes two wounds to 

the Guts. The Game Master rolls once and gets the 

Battered result, reducing the Sarge’s Vigor from d8 

to d6. Note that while the attack caused two wounds, 

the Game Master only rolled once on the Injury Table 

since it was one attack. 

Heroes Never Die 

Heroes in movies very rarely die. And when they do, they 
go down fighting or perform one last, epic act of heroism. 

With this rule in play, heroes who would normally die are 
simply knocked out for a dramatically appropriate time instead. 
Only if the situation is particularly heroic, or if it serves as a 
major story point can characters actually die. 

An adventurer who falls into a volcano, for example, 
might land on a floating piece of rock and leapfrog to safety. 
Conversely, if a hero confronts a massive demon on a 
crumbling bridge and suffers what would normally be a mortal 
wound, perhaps he does perish but the Game Master decides 
with his final blow he takes the demon into the boiling lava 
with him, allowing his companions to escape. 

. 
Villains: Of course the reverse of this rule is also true— 
villains never die either! The Game Master will need to explain 
the spirit of these rules to the group so their characters don’t 
take advantage of it by doing something gruesome and fatal 
to a fallen villain. In Heroes Never Die, the party is assumed 
to capture their rivals and turn them over to the authorities— 
where of course they eventually escape to return again. 
High Adventure 

Characters can spend a Benny to gain a one-time use of a 
Combat Edge. Player Characters have to meet the Rank and 
any Edge requirements, but can ignore Trait requirements for 
this one-time use. Multiple bennies can be spent in one round 
for multiple Edges, either for different effects or in order to 
meet a needed requirement to gain another Edge. 

Joker’s Wild 

This is a great rule to add to your game if you’re the kind 
of Game Master who’s a little stingy in awarding Bennies. It 
slightly ups the heroics and is a lot of fun for the group. 

When a player character draws a Joker during combat, he 
receives his normal +2 bonus to Trait and damage rolls. In 
addition, all player characters receive a Benny! 

Multiple Languages 

Some settings feature characters and cultures who typically 
speak many different languages. If this Setting Rule is in play, 
your hero knows his cultural or national language plus an 
additional number of languages equal to half his Smarts die. 
An elf with a d8 Smarts in a swords & sorcery campaign, for 
example, knows Elvish and four other languages—perhaps 
human, dwarven, and two others of her choosing. 

94 

No Power Points 


Skill Specialization 


Instead of using Power Points, characters with Arcane 
Backgrounds simply choose the power they want to activate 
and make an arcane skill roll. The penalty to the roll is half 
the power’s usual Power Point cost (rounded down). Casting 
the armor power, for example, which costs 2 Power Points, 
is an arcane skill roll at –1. 

Once cast, check the results below: 

• 
Success: The power activates as usual. 
• 
Raise: A raise on the roll grants any additional bonuses 
to the power stated in its description. Armor, for example, 
grants a +4 bonus to Toughness with a raise. 
• 
Failure: All currently maintained powers are cancelled 
and the caster is Shaken. 
. 
Backlash: Channeling magic, spiritual, or psionic 
energy, tinkering with unstable technology, and even using 
superpowers all come with certain risks. 
If a caster rolls a 1 on the arcane skill die when using one of 
his powers it automatically fails and he suffers 2d6 damage. 
Replace each Arcane Background’s specialized backlash 
rules with these: 

• 
Magic: Use the above Backlash results. 
• 
Miracles: As above, but the damage is reduced by half 
the priest’s Faith skill. 
• 
Psionics: Use the above Backlash rules, but the damage 
is applied to all sentient creatures within a Large Burst 
Template centered on the psionicist. 
• 
Super Powers: The hero does not suffer damage, but 
cannot use the power for the rest of this encounter or until 
he spends a Benny to negate the Backlash. 
• 
Weird Science: As above and the “device” is destroyed 
and must be rebuilt. This typically takes 1d3+1 hours, 
minus one hour for every success and raise on the 
Repair roll. 
. 
Maintaining Powers: Characters can maintain powers as 
long as desired, but each power maintained inflicts a –1 to 
cast any new powers. Thus an invisible mage can keep the 
power going indefinitely, but suffers a –1 penalty if he then 
attempts to hurl a bolt. 
. 
Interrupting Powers: If a character with an activated 
power is Shaken or suffers a wound or Fatigue level, he must 
make a Smarts roll to maintain all his powers. If the roll is 
failed, all powers are instantly dropped. A wizard with armor 
who suffers a Shaken result, for example, must make a Smarts 
roll. If the wizard suffers two wounds from an attack, he must 
make a Smarts roll at –2. 
Powers shut down automatically if the caster sleeps or is 
rendered unconscious. 

. 
Power Preparation: A caster may prepare a spell by 
concentrating for a round (no movement or other 
actions and avoid interruption, as described 
above). If successful, he ignores 2 points of 
penalties on all powers cast with his next action. 
If he does not enact any powers on his next 
action, the preparation is lost. 
Savage Worlds skills are intended to be broad, allowing 
characters to focus primarily on Edges for customization rather 
than multiple iterations of something like Fighting for edged 
weapons, Fighting for blunt weapons, etc. 

If it’s important to your setting to have more detail, a 
character uses his normal skill for one device of choice. When 
using any other variation he suffers a –2 penalty. 

Gaining an additional specialization counts as raising a skill 
below its linked Attribute. So a character can gain two new 
specializations with an Advance, or gain a specialization and 
increase a skill below its linked Attribute. 

Below are skills appropriate for this extra detail and some 
example specializations: 

• 
Boating: Powered, Sailed, Steam 
• 
Driving: Hover, Tracked, Wheeled 
• 
Fighting: Axe, Blunt Weapon, Exotic (such as nunchaku; 
each is separate), Long blade, Pole arm, Short blade. 
• 
Piloting: Fixed Wing, Rotary, Space 
• 
Riding: Camel, Horse, etc. 
• 
Shooting: Bow, Crossbow, Pistol, Rifle, Shotgun, etc. 
• 
Survival: Arctic, Desert, Temperate 
95 

Social Conflict 


Not every conflict is won by the blade. Successful oratory 
can topple nations. 

The following system works well for protracted and dramatic 
negotiations, such as convincing a council to send troops to 
a noble’s lands, winning a court case, or tricking a guard into 
opening the gates to the space station. 

The conflict is broken down into three rounds of conversation, 
each focusing on one particular point (or a few highly 
connected points). Further rounds represent the turn of 
conversation to additional points. 

Each round, the player character roleplays his argument 
and makes a Persuasion roll (or an opposed Persuasion roll 
if a rival is arguing against him). 

A speaker accumulates a success for each success and 
raise on the Persuasion roll (it’s best to keep track of this 
with tokens). 

At the end of the third round of conflict, the side with the 
most successes “wins” the argument. The more successes, 
the more convinced the target to be persuaded is, as shown 
on the Social Conflict Table below. 

. Modifiers: 
The Game Master should grant a +2 bonus to 
a side that makes a particularly brilliant or undeniable point; 
or a –2 penalty if the speaker commits a faux pas, such as 
making a provably untrue statement or insulting the audience 
he hopes to convince. 
. Knowledge Is Power: If the characters are arguing 
technical points, such as a legal battle or the best plan for a 
kingdom’s defense, the character must roll the lowest of his 
Persuasion or appropriate Knowledge roll. So for example a 
lawyer with a Persuasion of d10 and Knowledge (Law) of d4, 
would roll d4. It always pays to know what you’re talking about. 
Social Conflict Results 

Margin of Victory Result 

Tie The issue is unsettled and no action is taken until new 
and more compelling evidence can be presented 
to reopen the negotiation. In a court case, the 
defense would win as the burden of proof is on the 
prosecution. 

1-2 The target isn’t truly convinced but decides it’s better 
to be safe than sorry. He provides the minimum 
amount of support possible. In a court case, the jury 
barely finds reasonable doubt if the defense wins, or 
assigns minimal sentencing if the prosecution wins. 

3-4 The target is reasonably convinced. He grants the help 
requested, more or less, but may have conditions 
or ask favors in return. In a court case, the judge 
invokes severe sentencing if the prosecution wins. 
If the defense wins the defendant is cleared of all 
charges. 

5+ The target is sure of his decision. He provides more 
support than requested. If the prosecution wins in 
a court case, the defendant receives the maximum 
penalty.

 Example: To Arms! 

Orcs have invaded multiple baronies across the kingdom. 
The hero is a young noble attempting to convince the king to 
send royal troops to his aid. The king is disinclined to send 
his troops as a rebellion is also near-at-hand. 

The young noble begins by telling the king of his own battles 
against the orcs and the depredations they have committed 
across the kingdom. He makes his Persuasion roll and gets 
a 7. One success. 

The noble next presents his scouts who tell the king which 
baronies the orcs have been spotted in. The noble rolls again 
and gets a 9 for a total of three successes. 

Finally, the young warrior reminds the king that it was his 
family that supported his coronation, subtly implying that a 
debt is owed. This time, the noble fails. 

With three total successes, the king agrees to send a token 
force of infantry, but will not send his more loyal mounted 
knights. One of the infantry commanders, an old friend of 
noble’s family, is likely to rebel in the coming revolt, so the 
king not only sends him to the noble’s aid but also instructs 
an assassin to ensure he doesn’t return! The Game Master 
now has a new subplot to work into his adventure as the 
heroes try to prevent the assassination of their friend—and 
the commander of their allied troops.

Travel 
Most epic tales feature trips across great expanses— 
whether it’s the Hobbits’ quest to Mordor in The Lord of the 
Rings books or warping across space in a hard science-fiction 
tale. This section helps you figure out how long these journeys 
might take and what might dramatic events might happen 
along the way. 

Time and Distance 
Land Travel by Foot or Mount

A creature or character’s Base Speed is half its Pace in 
miles per hour, with a minimum of ½ mile per hour. A human 
with a Pace of 6, for example, walks about 3 miles per hour. 

Groups move at the speed of their slowest member. Fatigue 
and Encumbrance penalties don’t normally modify Pace, but 
the Game Master may choose to apply them when calculating 
overland movement rates if it’s dramatically appropriate. 

. Flying Speeds: Travelers with the luxury of flying mounts 
or some other means of leaving the ground behind may ignore 
the modifiers below and may be able to take shorter routes 
than the land-bound. Game Masters may adjust airspeeds for 
headwinds, thin air, smoke, or other aeronautical phenomena. 
Overland Speed Modifiers 

Ground 
Easy 
Speed 
– 0 mph 
Terrain Type 
Plains, road 
Average – 1 mph Rocky desert, light forest, low hills 
Hard – 2 mph Steep hills, sand, medium forest 
Difficult – 3 mph Mountains, heavy forest, marsh 

Vehicular Travel 

For reasonably paced travel over the course of one or more 
days, just use the vehicle’s Top Speed as its average miles 
per hour. 

Multiply Top Speed by the number of hours traveled (eight 
per day being typical) to see how far a vehicle can travel in 
one day. For example, a vehicle with a Top Speed of 40 could 
travel 320 miles in 8 hours. 

Multiply the mileage by 1.5 for interstate or autobahn travel, 
or by .5 if traveling over difficult terrain such as clogged 
highways in a post-apocalyptic aftermath, lack of roads, etc. 

Sailing Ships

Powered vessels use the same system as Vehicles, above. 
Sailing ships require more work on the part of the crew. Each 
day, the ship’s captain makes a Boating roll, plus or minus any 
modifiers the Game Master feels are appropriate for strong 
or weak winds, currents, traveling upriver, and so on. These 
rates are based on eight-hour stretches, but sailing ships with 
enough crew don’t usually stop, so multiply the results by three 
if the vessel sails the entire 24-hour period. 

• 
Total of 1 or Less: The craft is becalmed, goes in circles, 
or is effectively lost. It makes no progress that day and 
must make a Knowledge (Navigation) roll the following 
day or sail in a direction other than intended. 
• 
Failure: 3 x Top Speed in miles traveled 
• Success: 10 x Top Speed in miles traveled 
• Raise: 15 x Top Speed in miles traveled 
Encounters 

Unless the area traveled is patrolled, draw a card from the 
Action Deck once per day (or whatever period the Game 
Master feels is dramatically appropriate for the current scene). 
A face card or higher represents an encounter, and the card 
suit can be used to determine the type. 

Game Masters are highly encouraged to customize 
encounters based on their setting. 

Encounter Table 
• 
Clubs—Obstacle: The heroes encounter an obstacle of 
some kind and must figure out how to circumvent it. Some 
examples are a flooded river, minefields, a decaying 
rope bridge, whirlpool, etc. The obstacle might also be 
defended by creatures or enemies as well. 
• 
Hearts—NPCs: The group comes upon neutral or 
friendly nonplayer characters such as merchants, lost 
travelers, a guide, or even other adventurers. 
• 
Diamonds—Fortune: Somewhere along the way is 
something of value—the hulk of a spaceship full of 
supplies, a small treasure cache, a vein of useful or 
valuable minerals, or a minor magic item in the clutches 
of some unfortunate corpse. 
• 
Spades—Enemies: Monsters, enemies, or hostile 
beasts bar the way. Perhaps they lie in ambush if it’s 
known the heroes are coming this way.

Vehicles 
From armored combat in World War II to ship-to-ship battles 
on the high seas, vehicles often play a key role in the furious 
action of our Savage Settings. The following section contains 
rules for handling vehicle combat on the table-top. For more 
abstract Chases that take place over larger areas, see page 
82. 

Movement 

A vehicle’s Acceleration value is how many inches per turn it 
can increase its current speed. A pickup with an Acceleration 
of 5, for instance, can increase its movement by 5” every 
action, up to its Top Speed. A vehicle can decrease its speed 
by twice its Acceleration (or more in a Hard Brake—see 
Maneuvers). 

The player controlling the vehicle decides his speed at the 
beginning of his action, and moves it that many inches. The 
vehicle remains at that speed until the driver’s next action, so 
record the current speed somewhere for the next round and 
in case it hits something. 

Vehicles have some restrictions on maneuvering, particularly 
in how they turn. Use the Turning Template for normal turns, 
or perform a maneuver (see below) for tighter moves. 

. 
Action Cards: Vehicles move on their driver’s Action Card. 
Driving is a free action unless the driver attempts a maneuver. 
Passengers act on their own initiative as usual. 
. 
Speed Kills: It’s much easier to maneuver a vehicle slowly 
than it is at high speed. A vehicle moving over 15” a round 
on the tabletop inflicts a –2 handling penalty on its driver. A 
vehicle moving over 30” inflicts a –4 penalty. 
. 
Difficult Ground: Slippery gravel, uneven ground, and 
mud are all difficult ground and work just as for characters 
on foot. Count each inch moved through such rough terrain 
as two, and apply a –2 penalty to all Driving rolls made while 
in rough terrain. Driving through rough terrain at over half of 
Top Speed requires a Driving roll every round. 
. 
Reverse: A vehicle can move up to half its Top Speed 
in reverse. Driving rolls made while in reverse suffer a –2 
modifier. 
. 
Aircraft: Aircraft ignore terrain. Unless the aircraft has the 
ability to hover, it must move at least half its Top Speed each 
action. Climb isn’t used in table-top battles—only in Chases. 
. 
Animals and Conveyances: Animals don’t have to 
worry about Acceleration or Top Speed—they simply move 
their Pace (plus any running roll) each round. Animal-drawn 
transportation has an Acceleration equal to half the animal’s 
basic Pace. Carts and wagons don’t have a Top Speed 
because the animal simply moves its Pace as usual (plus a 
running die if it runs). 
Maneuvers 

Below are some common maneuvers with any penalty to 
the Driving roll listed in parentheses. If the maneuver is failed, 
move the vehicle to the point of the maneuver, then roll on the 
Out of Control Table to see where it actually ends up. 

• 
Bootlegger Reverse (–4): The vehicle moves forward 
at half its current speed and then turns between 90 and 
180 degrees (player’s choice). The vehicle instantly 
decelerates to a complete stop and cannot move further 
this round. 
• 
Hard Brake (0): The driver decelerates up to three times 
the vehicle’s Acceleration. 
Turning 
To perform turns when using miniatures on the table-top, use the Turning Template found at the back of this book. Simply 
line your vehicle up with the template and move it along the outside, as shown in the Turning diagram. Vehicles can perform 
tighter turns as a Maneuver (see Maneuvers). 

The car here is performing a turn to the 
left. This is the most it can turn without 
performing a maneuver. 

The car has moved 5”. 
This is its position at 
the end of its move.

1 
98 

• 
Jump (0): With a ramp, ground and water vehicles can 
jump a distance equal to one-quarter of their current 
speed, plus 1d10” with a raise on the Driving roll. They 
descend one inch for every two inches jumped forward, 
so a vehicle jumping 20” falls 10” by the end of its jump. 
• 
Maneuver (–1 to –4): This one covers most everything 
else a driver, rider, or pilot might try to do, such as riding 
a horse down a steep or slippery hill, avoiding a manhole 
cover or other obstacle, or driving through an oil slick at 
high speed. The GM sets the modifier. If the roll is failed, 
the driver goes out of control as usual. 
• 
Obstacle (–2 or more): Driving through a really tight 
obstacle looks easy enough on the tabletop since a 
vehicle is simply moved however the player wants. But 
in “reality,” the car is shifting around and is much more 
difficult to hold steady than the table-top shows. For this 
reason, drivers trying to pass through tight obstacles— 
narrow alleys, other cars, flying under power lines—must 
make Driving rolls. The standard difficulty is –2, but really 
tight spots might call for a –4 or greater penalty. If the roll 
is failed, the vehicle hits the obstacle and suffers collision 
damage as usual. 
• 
Ram (Opposed): Though we have to move vehicles 
in turns on the table-top, they’re actually moving 
simultaneously in the “real world.” For that reason, when 
one car rams another, we give the defender a chance 
to get out of the way—even if it’s not his turn. When this 
happens, the two drivers make opposed Driving rolls. 
If the attacker wins, he’s managed to ram his foe and 
damage is calculated normally. If the defender wins, 
he must move his vehicle just out of the way, whether 
backwards, forwards, or sideways. Sometimes cars run 
into people as well. In this case, the driver makes an 
opposed roll against the target’s Agility instead. 
• 
Tight Turn (0): The vehicle can turn up to 90 degrees. 
• 
Two Wheels (–4): Sometimes a character needs to put a 
wheeled vehicle on its side, maybe to squeeze through a 
narrow alley or avoid running over some deadly obstacle. 
Turning a vehicle up on two wheels requires a ramp of 
some kind—even an embankment can do the trick. The 
effect is to decrease the width of the car—usually by 
about 25%. The driver must make a Driving roll at the 
beginning of each turn he wants to keep the car up on 
two wheels. 
99 

Collisions 


Damage 


Collisions are very deadly in Savage Worlds. The damage 
to the vehicle and its passengers is 1d6 for every 5” of its 
current speed (round normally). If a motorcycle moving at 
16” per turn hits a tree, for instance, it suffers 3d6 damage, 
as does its rider and anything it rams into. 

. Relative Speeds: Increase the damage if a vehicle hits 
another object moving toward it. This is called “relative speed.” 
If two tanks ram into each other at a speed of 12, for instance, 
their relative speed is actually 24 and each tank suffers 4d6 
damage. Similarly, a vehicle moving away from an attacker 
subtracts its speed from the ramming vehicle’s. 
. Vehicular Armor: Vehicles with Heavy Armor add their 
Armor rating as an AP value to their damage. 
. Safety Harnesses: A seat belt protects anyone wearing 
it. Roll half the normal damage dice (round down) for these 
characters. Do the same for air bags, but subtract one 
additional die of damage as well. 
. Soft Obstacles: The collision rules assume the vehicle has 
hit something hard, like another vehicle, rock, wall, and so on. 
If the obstacle was soft, like a person, the damage is halved 
for the vehicle. The person takes damage normally, of course. 
. Falling or Jumping From Vehicles: Characters who fall 
from a moving vehicle suffer damage just as if they were in a 
collision. Characters who jump and make an Agility roll suffer 
half the usual damage dice (round down). If a character jumps 
out of a boat, treat this as nonlethal damage. 
Losing Control

Failing a Driving roll causes a vehicle to go “out of control.” 
When this happens, roll 2d6 on the Out of Control Table. 
Resolve any additional movement (such as slips or flips) 
immediately. Anything in the way gets smashed—check out 
the collision rules above if that happens. 

Vehicular Attacks 

Combat between vehicles and their crews works just like 
regular combat but with two additional modifiers. 

Attack Modifiers 
Penalty 
Situation 

–2 Unstable Platform 
–1 per 10” of Speed Fast Targets 

. Unstable Platform: Any character on an unstable 
platform, including a moving vehicle, suffers a –2 penalty to 
any “fine” physical skills such as Fighting and Shooting. This 
applies to characters who are firing vehicular weapons as 
well. Note that the Steady Hands Edge eliminates this penalty. 
. Fast Target: A fast-moving vehicle is more difficult to 
hit, and subtracts 1 from any attacks directed at it for every 
full 10” of its speed. This is relative, so a vehicle heading 
directly toward a character doesn’t get the modifier, nor does 
the modifier apply if the hero is shooting at a vehicle driving 
parallel to his own. 
Damage that equals or exceeds the vehicle’s Toughness 
forces the driver to make a Driving roll or go Out of Control 
(roll on the Out of Control Table). 

Each raise on the damage roll also inflicts a “wound.” Each 
wound caused to the vehicle inflicts a –1 penalty to the driver’s 
Driving skill rolls until someone repairs the damage. The 
attacker also scores a critical hit for each wound inflicted, and 
rolls on the Critical Hit Table to find out exactly what happened. 

When a vehicle takes its fourth wound, it is automatically 
wrecked and the driver must make a Driving roll or go out of 
control. 

A wrecked vehicle won’t run anymore, though its weapons 
may still be able to fire if they aren’t powered by the vehicle’s 
propulsion system. 

. Wrecked Aircraft: If an aircraft goes Out of Control, don’t 
use the usual table. Instead, the pilot makes a Piloting roll. If 
he fails, the aircraft crashes and is destroyed. If the pilot can 
eject, he gets one chance to do so by making an Agility roll. 
. Wrecked Watercraft: Unless the vessel is cracked open 
and sinks instantly, a wrecked boat sinks at the following rate: 
• 
Small craft (rowboats, canoes) sink at the end of the 
round in which they’re wrecked. 
• 
Medium craft, such as a fishing boat, sink in 1d6 minutes. 
• 
Large craft, such as a private yacht, sink in 4d6 minutes. 
• 
Ships, such as oil tankers, cruise ships, or naval vessels, 
sink in 2d6 hours. 
• 
A wrecked boat that hasn’t sunk drifts with the current 
(if any). This is typically 2d6” per round for fast-moving 
rivers, and 1d6” for most other rivers or in strong seas. 
In the ocean, the GM can roll 1d12 to determine which 
direction a vessel drifts. 
Repairs

Characters may repair vehicles given sufficient time and 
at least some basic tools. This requires a Repair roll that 
takes two hours per wound the vehicle has (regardless of 
how many are actually repaired). Attempting to fix up a tank 
that has suffered two wounds, for example, takes four hours 
regardless of the result of the Repair roll. 

Field work requires at least a toolbox and basic supplies, and 
subtracts 2 from the Repair roll. An average garage negates 
this penalty, and an excellent or dedicated facility adds +2. 

Each success and raise on the Repair roll fixes one of the 
vehicle’s wounds. With an additional raise above and beyond 
that required to fix all its wounds, the repair time is halved. 

. Wrecks: Wrecked vehicles can also be repaired, but it 
takes much more time and decent spare parts. The time is 
equal to 1d6 x 10 hours per wound level repaired. 
Example: Corporal Tunny has been tasked with 
patching the holes in a B-17 bomber with two wounds. 
He’s at the airbase with a dedicated garage and thus 
adds +2 to his rolls. Each attempt takes four hours, 
and each success and raise removes one wound. 

100 

Out of Control 
2d6 Effect 

2 Roll Over: The vehicle performs a Slip and rolls over 1d6 times in that direction. Roll collision damage for the 
vehicle and everyone inside. Any exterior-mounted weapons or accessories are ruined. 
3–4 Spin: Move the vehicle 1d6” in the direction of the maneuver, or 1d6” away from a damaging blow. Roll a d12, 
read it like a clock facing, and point the vehicle in that direction. 
5-9 Skid: Move the vehicle 1d4” left or right (in the direction of a failed maneuver, or away from a damaging attack). 
10–11 Slip: Move the vehicle 1d6” left or right (in the direction of a failed maneuver, or away from a damaging attack). 

12 Flip: The vehicle flips end over end 1d4 times. Move it forward that many increments of its own length. Roll 
collision damage for the vehicle, its passengers, and anything it hits. Slow and heavy vehicles such as tanks 
(GM’s discretion) don’t flip but suffer a Slip or Skid instead. 

Critical Hits 
2d6 Effect 
2 Scratch and Dent: The attack merely scratches the paint. There’s no permanent damage. 
3 Engine: The engine is hit. Oil leaks, pistons misfire, etc. Acceleration is halved (round down). This does not affect 

deceleration, however. 
4 Locomotion: The wheels, tracks, or whatever have been hit. Halve the vehicle’s Top Speed immediately. If the 
vehicle is pulled by animals, the shot hits one of them instead. 
5 Controls: The control system is hit. Until a Repair roll is made, the vehicle can only perform turns to one side (1–3 
left, 4–6 right). This may prohibit certain maneuvers as well. 
6–8 Chassis: The vehicle suffers a hit in the body with no special effects. 

9–10 Crew: A random crew member is hit. The damage from the attack is rerolled. If the character is inside the vehicle, 
subtract the vehicle’s Armor from the damage. Damage caused by an explosion affects all passengers in the 
vehicle. 

11 Weapon: A random weapon on the side of the vehicle that was hit is destroyed and may no longer be used. If 
there is no weapon, this is a Chassis hit instead. 
12 Wrecked: The vehicle is wrecked and automatically goes Out of Control. 


101 

Chapter Five: 
Powers 
Most roleplaying games feature “magic” in one form or 
another. Whether it’s hidden occult lore practiced only 
by dark cultists, voodoo rituals, the eldritch sorcery of 
powerful wizards, weird gadgets created by mad scientists, 
superpowers, or the psionic powers of the mind, these rules 
handle it all in one simple system. 

For ease of use, we call all of these effects “powers.” 
Best of all, powers work the same from game to game, but 
the particular use and Trappings give the same powers 
endless variations. That means you can create wizards, mad 
scientists, superheroes, and even creatures with one simple 
set of easy-to-remember rules. 

Making Arcane Characters 

Before we go any further, you need to make sure your GM 
will allow arcane characters in his game. You can’t make a 
wizard in a realistic military campaign, and mad scientists 
might not fit in every fantasy setting. 

Now that that’s out of the way, you need to buy the Arcane 
Background Edge and choose which type of supernatural 
power your hero is blessed with. 

Five different types of powers are presented in this rulebook: 
Magic, Miracles, Psionics, Super Powers, and Weird Science. 
All types of powers use the same basic mechanics but with a 
few important differences in the details. 

Let’s talk about what’s similar before we get into what’s 
different. 

Arcane Skill 

Each type of power has a particular arcane skill: Faith for 
miracles, Psionics for psionics, Spellcasting for magic, and 
Weird Science for weird science. Super powers use skills a 
little differently, as you’ll see on the following pages. 

You need to take the listed skill for your character’s particular 
Arcane Background and put points into it as usual. You’ll find 
the attribute the skill is linked to in parentheses beside the 
skill itself. 

Power Points 

Arcane characters energize their powers with “Power 
Points.” As soon as you buy an Arcane Background Edge, 
your hero gets the listed number of Power Points. 

Using a power requires that you spend a number of these 
points. Some powers allow you to pay additional points for 
better effects, and some allow you to maintain the effect by 
spending Power Points each round. 

Heroes recover 1 Power Point per hour. 

Starting Powers

Arcane characters start with a number of powers dictated 
by their particular Arcane Background. See the Arcane 
Background list for specifics. 

Learning New Powers

An arcane character can learn a new power by selecting 
the New Power Edge. As soon as he levels up and chooses 
this Edge, he can instantly begin using whichever power he 
chooses. 

102 

Using Powers 
As an action, a character may use a single power by 
declaring the power he’s using, spending the desired number 
of Power Points, and making an arcane skill roll. 

If the roll is failed, there’s no effect but the Power Points are 
lost. If successful, consult the particular power to determine 
the results. 

Some powers have variable effects depending on how many 
Power Points are used to cast them. The player must spend 
the desired Power Points before rolling his character’s arcane 
skill to see if he’s successful. 

Maintaining Powers

Some powers may be maintained, as listed in the power’s 
Duration description. This is a free action. The number 
following the duration is the cost in Power Points to keep the 
power going. No new skill roll is needed to maintain a power. 

For each power currently being maintained, the caster 
suffers a –1 to future arcane skill rolls (but not other Trait tests). 
A wizard maintaining armor and charm, for example, suffers 
a –2 penalty to his Spellcasting rolls until he allows those 
powers to lapse. He does not suffer penalties to his Fighting 
(or other) rolls while these spells are being maintained. 

Disruption

A character who is actively maintaining a power may be 
disrupted if he suffers damage. To maintain concentration 
for all of his powers, the hero makes one opposed arcane 
skill roll versus the damage he suffered. If his roll is 
higher, he maintains all of his spells. If he fails, he instantly 
drops all of his powers after the attack that caused the 
disruption is resolved. 

A character who is Shaken by non-damaging means (such 
as a Test of Wills) must make a simple Smarts roll to maintain 
his powers. 

Arcane Backgrounds 

Below are the five different types of Arcane Backgrounds. 
Each type describes the Arcane Skill a character with that 
background uses, his starting Power Points, the number of 
powers he starts play with, and any potential drawbacks to 
the power (such as Backlash or Malfunctions). 

Arcane Background (Magic) 

Arcane Skill: Spellcasting (Smarts) 

Starting Power Points: 10 

Starting Powers: 3 

Magicians range from powerful wizards to vile cultists. They 
draw on raw supernatural energy to fuel their eldritch fires. 
This energy often infuses the worlds in which they live, and 
is drawn forth with elaborate rituals, words of power, runes, 
or perhaps even dark sacrifices. 

Wizards are often quite weak early in their careers, but are 
forces to be reckoned with as they become powerful sorcerers. 

. 
Backlash: When a wizard rolls a 1 on his Spellcasting die 
(regardless of his Wild Die), he is automatically Shaken. This 
can cause a wound. 
Arcane Background (Miracles) 

Arcane Skill: Faith (Spirit) 
Starting Power Points: 10 
Starting Powers: 2 


Those who draw on miracles are priestly types or holy 
champions. Their power comes from a divine presence of 
some sort, including gods, nature, or spirits. Their powers are 
usually invoked with a few words of prayer or by performing 
established rituals. 

. 
Protector: Those who cast miracles are champions of their 
particular religions. Good priests vow to protect the innocent, 
fight evil, and obey all other tenets of their particular religion. 
Evil priests typically vow to defeat those who oppose their 
religion, or simply to cause as much misery and strife as 
possible. The player and Game Master should come up with 
a simple list of what is important to the character’s religion 
and use this as a guide. 
103 

Champions who violate their beliefs are temporarily or 
permanently forsaken by their chosen deity. Minor sins give 
the character a –2 to his Faith rolls for one week. Major 
sins rob him of all arcane powers for one week. Mortal sins 
cause the character to be forsaken until the penitent hero 
completes some great quest or task of atonement to regain 
his lost powers. 

Arcane Background (Psionics) 

Arcane Skill: Psionics (Smarts) 
Starting Power Points: 10 
Starting Powers: 3 


Psionicists have discovered how to tap into their own psychic 
powers. They can manipulate matter, create fire, or control 
their own bodies with but a thought. 

. 
Brainburn: When a psionic character rolls a 1 on his 
Psionics die (regardless of his Wild Die), he is automatically 
Shaken. On a critical failure, the psi lets out a psychic scream 
that causes him to be Shaken along with all allies in a Large 
Burst Template who fail a Spirit roll. This can cause a wound. 
Arcane Background (Super Powers) 

Arcane Skill: Special (None) 
Starting Power Points: 20 
Starting Powers: 1 


Characters with super powers gain their abilities through 
strange circumstances, such as being bitten by irradiated 
creatures, exposure to strange chemicals, or perhaps by 

finding alien artifacts. This particular level of power is intended 
for relatively low-level “pulp” heroes. More powerful super 
types are dealt with in specific Savage Settings, and you’ll 
find an alternate and far more detailed system in our Super 

Powers Companion. 

Super powers work a little differently from most other Arcane 
Backgrounds—each power is its own skill and has no linked 
attribute (and thus counts as “lower” than its linked Attribute 
for purposes of Advancement). A hero with the armor and 
bolt powers, for example, also has an Armor and a Bolt skill 
he uses to enable it. It’s more expensive for a character to 
improve his powers, but he starts with more Power Points 
than other arcane types so he can use his abilities more often. 

Best of all, there are no drawbacks for super powers as 
there are with other types of arcane powers—the power either 
works or it doesn’t. 

Arcane Background (Weird Science) 

Arcane Skill: Weird Science (Smarts—see below) 

Starting Power Points: 10 (but see below) 

Starting Powers: 1 

Weird Science is the creation of strange and powerful 
devices. It differs from regular science in that some element of 
the arcane is involved. Maybe it’s just generic “super-science,” 
or perhaps it’s divinely (or demonically) inspired. Maybe the 
science itself is relatively sound, but it derives power from an 
arcane source, such as ghost rock in Deadlands, or some 
other magical mineral or essence in a steampunk fantasy 
game. 

104 

Weird Science is different in that each new power is actually 
a new “gizmo.” The player must write down exactly what 
the device is when he gains the power. An inventor with the 
invisibility power, for instance, actually has an invisibility 
belt, cloak, etc. Players are encouraged to give their devices 
pseudo-scientific names as well (“Dr. Zee’s Chromatic 
Disfibulating Device!”). 

Weird Science is the skill an inventor uses when activating 
most devices, and raises increase the effects of the power 
as usual. If a device uses a different skill, such as Driving, 
Fighting, or Shooting, the inventor uses that instead. A ray 
gun, for example, uses the Shooting skill, while a “vibroknife” 
(a knife with the smite power) uses Fighting. 

Powers that require an opposed roll, such as puppet, also 
use the scientist’s Weird Science skill. 

Each device comes with its own Power Points equal to the 
inventor’s Power Points. An inventor with the bolt power and 
10 Power Points, for example, could make a ray gun that fires 
electrical beams. The gun has 10 Power Points it can use 
to fire the beams just like a wizard would cast the bolt spell. 

. 
Malfunction: Weird science devices are never perfect 
technology. They often suffer from spectacular and deadly 
malfunctions. If a gadgeteer uses a device and rolls a 1 on 
the skill die used to activate the gizmo, it has malfunctioned 
in some way and does not work. Draw a card and consult the 
Malfunction Table below: 
Weird Science Malfunction Table 

• 
Clubs—Catastrophic Malfunction: The device 
explodes for 2d6 damage in a Large Burst Template. 
• 
Hearts—Major Malfunction: The device breaks down. 
The gadgeteer may not use it again until it’s repaired, 
which requires a Repair roll and 2d6 hours of work. 
• 
Diamonds—Minor Malfunction: The device suffers a 
minor hang-up. It can be fixed with a Repair roll at –2. 
• 
Spades—Glitch: The gizmo activates but does the 
reverse of its intent. An invisibility belt makes the caster 
glow brightly, a weapon fires at a random target, and so 
on. If a reverse effect makes no sense, treat it as a Major 
Malfunction instead. 
. 
New Powers: Each time a Weird Scientist takes the 
New Power Edge, he has invented a new gadget. He simply 
chooses a power and decides what kind of gizmo it’s contained 
in as usual. He can also repeat a power he’s already taken. A 
mad scientist might want to create two ray-guns, for example, 
so that he can use one and give one to a companion. 
. 
Maintaining Powers: Because weird scientists use 
inventions rather than cast spells, they don’t suffer any 
penalties for maintaining powers, but their devices still pay 
the maintenance costs in Power Points as usual. 

. 
Recharging: Devices regain Power Points just like a 
character, at the rate of one point per hour. Recharging may 
represent the device being plugged into an outlet, gathering 
solar rays, or even fritzing out for a while until it miraculously 
just starts working again. Regardless of the description, 
however, it regains Power Points at the rate of one per hour 
just like other power types. 
The Power Edges Rapid Recharge and Improved Rapid 
Recharge apply to all of the inventor’s devices rather than 
the inventor himself. 

More on Weird Science 

Weird Science is a little more complicated than other Arcane 
Backgrounds and requires a bit more explanation. First off, 
it’s important to understand Weird Science isn’t used to make 
mundane devices, even if they are extraordinary. As long 
as they’re possible and aren’t too far above the given tech 
level of the world, they’re just “high-tech.” Only actual weird 
science, inspired by, created by, or powered by some sort of 
supernatural force qualifies. 

It’s also important to remember that Weird Science doesn’t 
allow a character to make anything he wants. He can only 
make a device that utilizes one of the powers in this book (or 
an appropriate Savage Setting). 

. 
Sharing: An inventor can hand his device over to a 
companion to use. The device works the same for the 
companion as it does for the owner. If the Weird Science skill 
is required, the companion must make a default roll as usual. 
That means gizmos are typically more effective when used 
by weird scientists than in the hands of others. 
. 
Soul Drain: Weird Scientists cannot take the Soul Drain 
Edge. 
. 
More Power Points: When an inventor gains more Power 
Points, he’s assumed to tinker with his existing devices and 
upgrade them as well. This means all of his devices gain the 
additional Power Points. In effect, if an inventor has 20 Power 
Points, each of his devices have 20 Power Points as well. 
. 
Losing Devices: If an inventor’s gizmo is taken away, lost, 
or destroyed, he can make another in 2d6 hours as long as 
he has access to a workshop and some basic components. 
This requires a Repair roll. A raise halves the time needed to 
create the device. 
If the original should somehow be returned, it no longer 
functions (the character doesn’t get a “free” duplicate in this 
way). 

Example: Doctor Gold starts play with a vibroknife 
(a knife with the smite power) and 10 Power Points. 
Later on, he levels up and chooses the New Power 
Edge. With that he invents a ray-gun with the bolt 
power. Both devices have 10 Power Points. 

In a fight, Doctor Gold first “turns on” his vibroknife 

by making a Weird Science roll. He gets a raise so 

the knife does +4 damage for its duration. The ray-gun 

doesn’t have to be activated. The Doc simply makes 

a Shooting roll whenever he fires it (just like a mage 
would make a Spellcasting roll).

Trappings & Effects 

Trappings are the heart and soul of the powers system. With 
just a few simple twists, a bolt power can represent rays of 
ice, streaks of light, or swarms of stinging bees. 

The powers themselves are designed to be as simple 
to use and remember as possible. This helps the Game 
Master remember what all the powers do, and helps players 
remember the rules for common powers even between 
different settings. But just because these powers work the 
same from setting to setting doesn’t mean they have to look 
the same, have the same names (to the characters in that 
world), or even have the exact same effects—that’s where 
Trappings come in. 

For the most part, Trappings should be merely cosmetic as 
described on page 108. But sometimes it makes sense for 
there to be additional effects. A heat ray should have a chance 
of catching combustible objects on fire, for example, and an 
electric blast should do slightly more damage to targets in 
full metal armor. 

Below are examples of effects players and Game Masters 
can use for common Trappings. 

Acid 

Acid is most commonly an attack Trapping, but could be 
used defensively against those who touch it (such as armor 
that corrodes anyone who touches it). 

• 
Corrosion: If the subject with an acidic Trapping is 
touched the victim must make a Vigor roll or suffer Fatigue 
(the equivalent of Bumps and Bruises). If the ability is a 
damaging attack that results in a Shaken or higher result, 
roll a d6. On a 6, any material the acid hit is ruined (armor 
loses a point of protection instead). 
• 
Burn: A power that does fixed damage reduces its die 
type by one, but does one less die of damage on the 
caster’s next action unless counteracted in some way 
(taking an action to wash it off or stripping off the acid-
covered item). For instance, a 2 PP acid bolt causes 3d4 
when it hits and 2d4 on the caster’s action as well (unless 
the target neutralizes it with liquid). 
Cold/Ice

Cold and ice cause freezing effects, and can be both positive 
and negative. 

• 
Armor: Beneficial powers provide +2 Armor versus cold, 
ice, fire, and heat, but fire and heat attacks count as a 
dispel against them. 
• 
Fatigue: Harmful powers require a Vigor roll (at –2 on a 
raise) to avoid cold-based Fatigue, but the power’s range 
is reduced to half (non-ranged powers have their Power 
Point cost doubled). 
• 
Skate: 
A success on a beneficial power (like armor) 
results in ice not counting as Difficult Ground as ice spikes 
or skates form on the target’s feet. 
• 
Slow:A raise with a detrimental power (like stun) results 
in the target’s movement counting as Difficult Ground 
while the power is active (or his next movement for Instant 
powers) due to the slick ice frozen on him. 
Darkness 

Darkness is frequently tied to another trapping such as cold 
or necromantic, so those options can apply as well. 

• 
Darkening: Targets suffer a penalty to oppose the power 
equal to the current darkness penalty. The caster suffers 
a –2 penalty in normal light, and the light power works 
as dispel against the power. 
• 
Shroud:The target is momentarily shrouded in tendrils of 
darkness. Targets of negative powers suffer a –1 penalty 
to all vision-based trait rolls while the power is active or 
on their next action for Instant powers. Positive effects 
slightly obscure the character, making him –1 to be hit 
by ranged attacks. 
• 
Stealth: 
For beneficial powers, adding +1 Power Point 
to the cost causes the darkness to cling to the target 
and increases Stealth by one die type, or two on a raise. 
Electricity

Electricity has a strong impact on the body’s nervous and 
muscular systems. 

• 
Armor Piercing: The electricity arcs to a foe’s exposed 
areas, ignoring some armor (AP 2) at a cost of +1 Power 
Point. 
• 
Conduction: Damaging powers reduce damage by one 
die type, but add an additional die of damage to targets 
in the following situations: carrying more than 10 pounds 
of conductive metal, contacting a source of water, or 
otherwise touching an electrical conductor of some kind. 
For instance, an electrical blast at maximum effect does 
3d4 damage in a Large Burst Template, but if the targets 
are standing in water, they take 4d4 damage. 
• 
Jazz: Beneficial powers “jazz” the target. They cost +1 
Power Point to cast, but on a success add +2 to Pace and 
on a raise increase Agility one die type for the duration 
of the power. 
• 
Jolt: Helpful powers shock a target out of their distraction 
on a raise, providing an immediate free roll to recover 
from being Shaken. 
• 
Spasms: 
Harmful powers cause temporary muscle 
contraction if cast with a raise; the target has to make a 
Vigor roll or be at –2 Parry until his next action. 
Fire/Heat

Fire is a very common trapping for attack powers with heat 
having similar but less combustible effects. 

• 
Armor Piercing: Fire and heat bypass cracks in armor. 
A damaging power gains AP 2 by increasing the base 
cost by +1 Power Point. 
• 
Aura: Beneficial powers surround a subject with a hot or 
fiery aura, and as a replacement for their normal benefit 
on a raise, the target gains the effect of the damage field 
power that causes 2d4 damage. 
• 
Fatigue: A heat trapping on an attack forces the victim 
to make a Vigor roll or suffer Fatigue. 
• 
Flammable: With a hit by a fire power, roll for any 
potentially flammable objects to catch fire (see page 83). 
For a heat trapping, liquids on the target (water, potions, 
etc.) evaporate on a 6 on a d6 with a success or a 4–6 
on a raise. 
106 

Design Note - The Power of Names
Light

Light typically represents goodness, sunshine, or holiness. 

• 
Beam: Light-based damaging attacks are like a focused 
laser, providing armor piercing capability. Reduce the 
damage by one die type, but add AP 4 to the effect. 
• 
Enhance: This trapping applies directly to the light power. 
Reduce it to a Medium Burst Template and extend the 
duration to 1 hour (1/hour) or give it a range of Smarts 
x 2 affecting animate targets as well (an unwilling target 
gets an opposed Agility roll to avoid). Reduce light to a 
Small Burst Template and give it both abilities. 
• 
Glow: Subjects affected with a raise glow for the duration, 
creating light in a Small Burst Template centered on them. 
This can give them light, but also make them targets. An 
Instant power with that effect allows a character on Hold 
or with the Joker to make an attack for the split second the 
subject is illuminated (avoiding any darkness penalties to 
hit them). The character must take his action immediately 
after the caster’s turn to gain the benefit. 
• 
Sunlight: 
In a setting with vampires and other such 
creatures, light is equivalent to natural sunlight. 
Necromantic 

Necromantic trappings may involve a “negative energy” 
opposed to life or symbols of death like bones and skulls. 

• 
Fear: All Undead (depending on their prevalence) are 
considered to have a level of Arcane Resistance versus 
the power, and the living must make Fear checks when 
hit with it. 
• 
Feign Undeath: A raise on the roll provides a –1 to be hit 
by Undead as they see the subject as one of their own. 
• 
Shards: 
Ranged attacks splinter on impact, creating 
shrapnel that does +1 damage versus unarmored 
targets but –1 damage versus foes with 
Armor. 
Sound 

Sound is a common trapping for sonic 
or music-based spellcasters. Sound-
based powers should never work in 
a vacuum! 

• 
Absorbtion: Beneficial powers 
absorb the subject’s sound, so Stealth is increased a 
die type, but they have to yell to be heard normally and 
speaking becomes a normal action instead of a free one. 
• 
Aquatic Boom: Sound travels better in water than in air. 
Underwater, an attack power causes +2 damage. In air, 
however, it causes –2 damage. 
• 
Deafen: A raise with the power (or a Shaken or better 
from damage) results in a –2 penalty to hearing-based 
Notice rolls for the target until the power ends or they 
recover from being Shaken. 
What really makes powers stand out in a setting are 
their names, particularly if they’re spells or miracles. 
Nickodemus’ Necrotic Surge sounds much more 
frightening than bolt. 

It’s important for official Savage Worlds books to 
use the simpler nomenclature for ease of reference. 
We don’t want you to have to look up every power 
listed under a spellcaster’s repertoire after you’ve 
become familiar with the standard powers. You 
should encourage your players, however, to use more 
descriptive names. 

If the group in a modern-day horror game finds a 

scroll of armor, that’s probably much more rare and 

exciting than it would be in a fantasy game. Give it a 

name like Blessing of the Faithful and then tell them 
it works “just like the armor spell.” They’ll get the idea 
and the extremely functional and flexible powers 
system will convey much more flavor and excitement. 

107 

Powers 
Listed below are a number of powers available in most 
Savage Settings. Each power has the following statistics: 

. 
Rank: This is the Rank a character must be in order to learn 
this power: Novice, Seasoned, Veteran, Heroic, or Legendary. 
. 
Power Points: The number of points it costs to use the 
power. Some powers allow the character to pay additional 
points for additional effects. This is always determined—and 
paid for—before the dice are rolled. 
. 
Range: The maximum distance the target of the power can 
be from the user when the power is first activated (it remains 
in effect even if the target moves out of Range as long as 
it’s maintained). A Range of Smarts, for example, means 10” 
for a character with a Smarts of d10. If a power lists three 
Ranges, such as 12/24/48, these are read just like missile 
weapon Ranges, and subtract the standard penalties for each 
Range bracket (0/–2/–4). The arcane character’s skill roll acts 
as both his “casting” and attack total for these type powers 
(Weird Scientists use Fighting or Shooting as usual instead). 
. 
Duration: How long the power lasts in rounds. Apower with 
a Duration of 1 lasts until the heroes’ next action. A Duration 
of 2 means it lasts for two actions, and so on. 
If the Duration of a power has a second entry in parentheses, 
such as 3 (1/round), it means the power has a Duration of 3 
rounds and may then be maintained from round to round by 
spending the listed number of Power Points (1 in this case). 
Each power maintained subtracts 1 from future uses of the 
hero’s arcane skill. 

. 
Trappings: Listed here are some ideas for what the power 
might look like in different types of settings. In a science fiction 
game, armor might represent the psyker’s telekinetic force 
pushing attacks away from him. The same power used by a 
superhero might be a force field, or a body of flame that melts 
incoming projectiles. 
Example: Greywald the Melodious is a bard in a 

high-fantasy setting. In battle, he strums his lyre or 

sings songs to enable his powers. 

His burst is a sonic cone that rattles nerves and 
shatters eardrums. He calls this one “The Battle Cry 
of Evanier.” Greywald’s slumber is “Lullaby of the 
Fallen,” a sad mournful tune that puts his enemies to 
sleep even in the heat of battle. 

Greywald’s player has decided for himself that he 
won’t take powers that don’t work well within his 
theme—such as disguise or elemental manipulation. 


108 

Armor 

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 2 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 3 (1/round) 
Trappings: A mystical glow, hardened skin, ethereal armor, 
a mass of insects or worms. 


Armor creates a field of magical protection around a 
character or an actual shell of some sort, effectively giving the 
target Armor. Success grants the recipient 2 points of Armor. 
A raise grants 4 points of Armor. 

Whether the armor is visible or not depends largely on the 
trapping. 

Banish 

Rank: Veteran 
Power Points: 3 
Range: Smarts 
Duration: Instant 
Trappings: Holy items, arcane symbols, handful of salt. 

Whether ghosts, elementals, or demons, banish removes 
them all. This power can affect any creature that is not native 
to the current plane of existence (GM’s determination). 

This spell is an opposed roll of the caster’s arcane skill 
versus the target’s Spirit. On a success, the target is Shaken. 
On a raise, it is sent to its proper plane of existence. 

If the target is a Wild Card, each casting of banish causes 
a wound instead. If the target already has three wounds, it is 
then banished to its native plane—but it is not slain. 

Barrier 

Rank: Seasoned 
Power Points: 1/section 
Range: Smarts 
Duration: 3 (1 per section, per round) 
Trappings: Fire, ice, thorns, force, bones. 

Barrier creates a solid, immobile wall to protect the user 
against attack or to entrap an opponent. 

Regardless of what the barrier is made of (ice, thorns, stone, 
energy, etc.), it has a Toughness of 10. Every Power Point 
spent creates a 1” wide section of wall. The barrier ranges in 
thickness from a few “real world” inches for stone or other hard 
materials up to a foot for things like bones or ice. (If you’re 
using a gridded mat to play, draw the barrier between the 
squares directly along the grid-lines.) The exact placement of 
each section is defined by the caster, but each section must 
be connected to at least one other section after the first. 

When the spell expires or a section is broken, it crumbles to 
dust or dissipates. Trappings are never left behind. 

Each section of the barrier may be destroyed by an attack 
that equals its Toughness of 10. Physical walls are treated 
exactly like inanimate objects; they are considered to have 
a Parry of 2 (ranged attacks work as normal), but raises on 
the attack roll do not grant bonus damage nor do damage 
dice Ace. Opponents may climb the barrier at –2 to their 
Climbing roll if it is made of something solid. Fiery versions 
of the barrier cause 2d4 damage to anyone who wishes to 
leap through instead. 

Beast Friend 

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: Special 
Range: Smarts x 100 yards 
Duration: 10 minutes 
Trappings: The mage concentrates and gestures with his 
hands. 

This spell allows mages to speak with and guide the actions 
of nature’s beasts. It works only on creatures with animal 
intelligence, not humanoids. Nor does it work on conjured, 
magical, or otherwise “unnatural” animals. 

The target must be within the sorcerer’s range — it is not 
conjured. 

The cost to control a creature depends on its Size. The base 
cost is 3, plus twice its Size for creatures with a Size greater 
than 0. A great white shark (Size +4) costs 3 plus 8 (2x4), or 
11 points. A roc (Size +8) costs 19 Power Points to control. 

Swarms may also be controlled. Small swarms cost 3, 
Mediums 5, and Large 8. Thus a single rat costs 3 to control, 
as does a small swarm of the creatures. 

Blast 

Rank: Seasoned 
Power Points: 2–6 
Range: 24/48/96 
Duration: Instant 
Trappings: Balls of fire, ice, light, darkness, colored bolts, 
swarm of insects. 

Blast is an area effect power that can put down many 
opponents at once. The caster first picks where he wants to 
center the blast, then makes the appropriate skill roll. Normal 
ranged attack modifiers apply. 

The area of effect is a Medium Burst Template. If the roll is 
failed, the blast deviates as a launched projectile. 

Targets within the blast suffer 2d6 damage. Blast counts as 
a Heavy Weapon. 

. 
Additional Effects: For double the Power Points, the blast 
does 3d6 damage, or the size is increased to a Large Burst 
Template. For triple the points, it does both. 
Blind 

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 2–6 
Range: 12/24/48 
Duration: Instant 
Trappings: Bright flash of light, sand in eyes, sticky shadows. 

This power temporarily blinds a target or targets. Those 
affected must make an Agility roll at –2 to avert their gaze and 
avoid the effect (at –4 if the caster got a raise on the attack 
roll). On a failure, victims are Shaken and –2 to Parry until their 
next action. If the target rolls a 1 on his Agility die (regardless 
of the Wild Die), he’s Shaken and fully blind until he recovers 
from being Shaken. Blinded victims suffer a –6 penalty to all 
Trait rolls that require vision and have their Parry reduced to 2. 

. 
Additional Effects: For 2 Power Points, the power affects 
a single target. For 4 Power Points, the power affects everyone 
in a Medium Burst Template. For 6 points, it affects everyone 
in a Large Burst Template. 
109 

Bolt 

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 1 per missile 
Range: 12/24/48 
Duration: Instant 
Trappings: Fire, ice, light, darkness, colored bolts, insects. 

Bolt is a standard attack power of wizards, and can also be 
used for ray guns, bursts of energy, streaks of holy light, and 
other ranged attacks. The damage of the bolt is 2d6. 

. 
Additional Bolts: The character may cast up to 3 bolts 
by spending a like amount of Power Points. The bolts may 
be spread among targets as the character chooses. This is 
rolled just like fully-automatic weapons fire but without the full-
auto penalty—the character rolls a spellcasting die for each 
bolt and compares each to the Target Number separately. If 
the caster is a Wild Card, he also rolls a Wild Die, which may 
replace any of the casting dice. 
. 
Additional Damage: The caster may instead cast a single 
3d6 bolt for 2 Power Points. He may not cast multiple bolts 
when using this ability. 
Boost/Lower Trait

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 2 
Range: Smarts 
Duration: 3 (1/round) 
Trappings: Physical change, glowing aura, potions. 

This power allows a character to increase any of a target’s 
Traits by one die type for a standard success, or by two with a 
raise. The affected Trait can exceed d12. Each step over d12 
adds +1 to his Trait total. For example, a raise on someone 
who already has a d12 in the affected Trait grants him d12+2 
for the duration of the power. 

The power can also be used to lower an opponent’s Trait. 
This is an opposed roll against the victim’s Spirit. Success 
lowers any Trait of the caster’s choice one step, a raise lowers 
it two steps. A Trait cannot be lowered below a d4. Multiple 
castings stack, though the caster must keep track of when 
each casting expires as usual. 

. 
Additional Targets: The power may affect an additional 
target for every additional Power Point spent, up to a maximum 
of five targets. All targets share the same effect and Trait 
affected. 
Burrow 

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 3 
Range: Smarts x 2 
Duration: 3 (2/round) 
Trappings: Dissolving into the earth and appearing elsewhere. 

Burrow 
allows a mage standing on raw earth to meld into it. 
He can remain underground if he wants in a sort of “limbo” or 
burrow 
to anywhere with a Pace equal to the power’s Range. 
A mage with a Smarts of d8 could therefore move up to 16” 
(32 yards) on the first round, then maintain the spell and stay 
submerged for the second and move another 16”. 

A burrowing 
earth mage can attempt to surprise a foe (even 
one who saw him burrow) by making an opposed Stealth 
versus Notice roll. If the mage wins, he gains +2 to attack 
and damage that round, or +4 with a raise. Targets on Hold 
may attempt to interrupt the attack as usual. 

. 
Additional Targets: The power may affect an additional 
target for every additional Power Point spent, up to a maximum 
of five targets. 
Burst 

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 2 
Range: Cone Template 
Duration: Instant 
Trappings: A shower of flames, light, or other energy. 

Burst produces a large fan of energy that bathes its targets 
in red-hot fire or other damaging energy. 

When cast, place the thin end of the Cone Template at 
the character’s front. Targets within the template may make 
Agility rolls versus the caster’s arcane skill roll to avoid the 
blaze. Those who fail suffer 2d10 damage. This counts as a 
Heavy Weapon. 

110 

Confusion 

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 1 
Range: Smarts x 2 
Duration: Instant 
Trappings: Hypnotic lights, brief illusions, loud noises. 

Instilling confusion in enemies is a powerful aid in combat, 
and this power provides that ability. On a success, a target 
must make a Smarts roll at –2 or be Shaken, and on a raise, 
the roll is made at –4. 

. 
Additional Targets: The character may affect up to five 
targets by spending a like amount of additional Power Points. 
Damage Field

Rank: Seasoned 
Power Points: 4 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 3 (2/round) 
Trappings: Fiery aura, spikes, electrical field. 

Damage field creates an effect around a character that 
deals damage to anyone who contacts them in close combat. 
The damage affects any adjacent character who makes a 
successful attack roll against the subject. It has no effect 
on non-adjacent attackers (for example, Reach or ranged 
attacks). 

If a character with a damage field strikes someone in 
unarmed combat, the target takes the field’s damage plus 
the character’s Strength die (Str+2d6). The character may 
also simply touch the opponent (+2 to Fighting) and do the 
field’s damage only. A target who is grappled suffers the field’s 
damage each round on the attacker’s action; if the attacker 
chooses on following rounds to actively damage the target, 
he adds his Strength die to the damage roll as above and 
may get a bonus die for a raise. 

With a success, the power does 2d6 damage. With a raise, 
damage field causes 2d8 damage. 

Darksight

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 1 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 1 hour (1/hour) 
Trappings: Glowing eyes, dilated pupils, sonic sight. 

Whereas light creates a source of illumination usable by 
others, darksight affects only a single person and can be 
much more clandestine. 

On a success, this spell halves any darkness penalty for the 
subject (round down). For example, a character in Dim (–1) 
lighting would suffer no penalty, and one in Pitch Darkness 
(–4) would only suffer a –2. On a raise, the spell negates all 
darkness penalties up to the maximum of –6. 

. 
Additional Targets: The character may affect up to five 
targets by spending a like amount of additional Power Points. 
Deflection 


Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 2 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 3 (1/round) 

Trappings: Mystical shield, gust of wind, phantom servant 
that intercepts the missiles. 

Deflection powers work in a variety of ways. Some actually 
deflect incoming attacks, others blur the target’s form or 
produce other illusionary effects. The end result is always 
the same however — to misdirect incoming melee and missile 
attacks from the user. 

With a standard success, attackers must subtract 2 from any 
Fighting, Shooting, or other attack rolls directed at the user. 
A raise increases the penalty to –4. This also acts as Armor 
against area effect weapons. 

Detect/Conceal Arcana

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 2 
Range: Sight 
Duration: 3 (1/round) or 1 hour (1/hour) 
Trappings: Waving hands, whispered words. 

Detect/conceal arcana allows a character to sense 
supernatural persons, objects, or effects within sight. This 
includes invisible foes, enchantments on people or items, 
mad science devices, and so on. 

The power can also be reversed to conceal a single 
supernatural item, being, or effect. This has the same cost, 
but the duration is much longer — 1 hour with a maintenance 
cost of 1 per hour. When used in this way, those who wish 
to see through the ruse with detect arcana use their arcane 
skill roll as an opposed roll against the concealer’s skill (rolled 
anew each time detect arcana is cast). The detecting character 
may only attempt to see through concealed powers once per 
fresh casting. 

Disguise

Rank: Seasoned 
Power Points: 3 – 5 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 10 minutes (1/10 minutes) 
Trappings: Malleable features, illusionary appearance, hair 
of new form. 

Disguise allows the character to assume the appearance 
(but none of the abilities) of another person. The base cost 
is 3 Power Points, plus 1 point per level of Size difference 
between the character and the person she is impersonating. 
The character cannot emulate someone more than 2 Size 
levels different from themselves. It requires a Notice roll at 
–2 to see through disguise if someone is familiar with the 
specific person mimicked; the penalty increases to –4 with a 
raise. If unfamiliar, the penalties are –4 and –6 respectively. 

Dispel

Rank: Seasoned 
Power Points: 3 
Range: Smarts 
Duration: Instant 
Trappings: Waving hands, whispered words. 

Dispel allows a hero to negate enemy spells, miracles, mad 
science, or super powers. It has no effect on innate powers, 
such as a dragon’s breath or a banshee’s scream. Neither 
does dispel work on magic items or permanent enchantments 
unless the specific item or enchantment says otherwise. 

111 

Dispel can be used on a power already in effect or to counter 
an enemy power as it’s being used. The latter requires the 
countering mage to be on Hold and interrupt his foe’s action 
as usual. 

In either case, dispelling the opponent’s power is an opposed 
roll of arcane skills. The dispelling character suffers a –2 
modifier if the target power is of another type (magic vs. 
miracles, superpowers vs. mad science, etc). 

Divination 

Rank: Heroic 
Power Points: 5 
Range: Self 
Duration: 1 minute 
Trappings: Contact spirits of dead, commune with deity, 
demonic interrogation. 

This power allows the caster to contact an otherworldly 
being to gain information. Due to the extraplanar nature of 
this power, it is very draining to the caster. 

On a success, the caster may ask one question that can be 
answered by “Yes,” “No,” or “Possibly” (if there is no absolute 
answer). On a raise, the question may be answered in five 
words or less (the GM may allow a longer, more detailed 
answer in cryptic form). 

The spell’s duration is one minute, during which the caster 
may take no other actions or movement. If the caster is 
Shaken during that time, he must make a Smarts roll or the 
power is disrupted. 

If the question relates to a living being (including beings who 
may “live” by mystical means such as undead, constructs, 

elementals, etc.), then the arcane skill roll is opposed by their 
Spirit. Divination is also opposed by conceal arcana. In the 
case of conceal arcana on a being, the divination must first 
beat the conceal arcana, and then if successful, the subject 
may roll Spirit against the divination result. 

Drain Power Points 

Rank: Heroic 
Power Points: 3 
Range: Smarts 
Duration: Instant 
Trappings: Prayer, whispered words, gestures. 

This spell removes a spellcaster’s source of power, limiting 
his ability to cast magic. 

The caster picks a single target within range and makes 
an opposed arcane skill roll. The caster suffers a –2 modifier 
if the target power is of another type (magic vs. miracles, 
superpowers vs. mad science, for example). 

With a success, he drains 1d6+1 Power Points from the 
victim. On a raise, the victim loses 1d8+2 Power Points. 
These rolls don’t Ace. Targets with Arcane Background: 
Weird Science lose the Power Points from all “gizmos” on 
their person equally. 

The victim cannot be reduced below zero Power Points. 
Drained Power Points are not taken by the caster — they are 
simply lost to the victim. Drained Power Points recharge as 
normal. The spell works only on creatures with an Arcane 
Background — it has no effect on magic items except those 
created through Arcane Background: Weird Science as noted 
above. 

Elemental Manipulation

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 1 
Range: Smarts x 2 
Duration: 3 (1/round) 
Trappings: A few simple gestures. 

A character who chooses this power can perform basic 
“tricks” using the four elements: air, earth, fire, and water 
(these elements may vary depending on the setting). The GM 
is the final arbiter on what effects can be performed (nothing 
that mimics another power), but some examples are listed 
below. 

. 
Air: The caster can create lesser air currents to blow out a 
candle, fan a flame, lift a skirt, or cool his body in oppressive 
heat (+1 to a single Fatigue roll caused by heat). 
. 
Earth: A wave of the hand can open a one-foot square hole 
in soft earth (or half that in stone), or cause a spray of sand 
that might blind an opponent (+1 to a Trick roll). 
. 
Fire: The caster can snap his fingers to create a small 
flame (about the size of a hot match). With existing fire, he can 
urge it to spread (+1 to see if a fire spreads), cause it to flare 
(perhaps as part of a Trick maneuver), or slowly light an object 
over the course of a few rounds (as if holding a match to it). 
. 
Water: The caster can conjure up to a pint of water 
somewhere within his sight (not “inside” objects or people). 
A wave of his hand also purifies one gallon of water, whether 
it be poisoned or simply salt-water. Those who have been 
112 

poisoned within the last minute also get a second chance to 
resist any remaining effects. 

Entangle

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 2 – 4 
Range: Smarts 
Duration: Special 
Trappings: Glue bomb, vines, handcuffs, spider webs. 

This power allows the character to restrain a target with 
snaking vines, lengths of hair, spider webs, or some other 
vine-like trapping. 

The arcane skill roll is opposed by the target’s Agility. 
Success indicates partial restraint so that the target suffers 
a –2 penalty to Pace and skills linked to Agility and Strength. 
A raise restrains the target fully. He cannot move or use any 
skills linked to Agility or Strength. 

Each following action, an entangled target may make a 
Strength or Agility roll to break free. Other characters may also 
attempt to free the ensnared person by making a Strength 
roll at –2. 

For 2 Power Points entangle targets a single opponent. 
For 4 points it affects everyone in a Medium Burst Template. 

Environmental Protection 

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 2 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 1 hour (1/hour) 
Trappings: A mark on the forehead, potions, gills. 

Adventurers sometimes travel beneath the waves, in space, 
or other hazardous environments. This power protects them 
from the crushing depths or blazing sun as they do. 

This power allows the target to breathe, speak, and move at 
his normal Pace while in one normally harmful environment, 
such as underwater, a zero-G vacuum, the lava of a volcano, 
or even the heat of the sun. Pressure, atmosphere, air, etc, 
are all provided for. 

The power does not protect against attacks with similar 
trappings though. A fire attack still causes normal damage, 
for example. With a raise on the casting roll, maintaining the 
power becomes 1 Power Point per two hours. 

. 
Additional Targets: The character may affect up to five 
targets by spending a like amount of additional Power Points. 
Farsight

Rank: Seasoned 
Power Points: 3 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 3 (1/round) 
Trappings: Invisibly marked targets, guiding winds, eagle 
eyes. 

This spell endows the recipient to see over great distances. 
With a success, ranged penalties are halved for the subject 
(–1 at Medium and –2 at Long). If a raise is achieved, all range 
increments for the subject are doubled in addition (12/24/48 
becomes 24/48/96). 

Fear 

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 2 
Range: Smarts x 2 
Duration: Instant 
Trappings: Gestures, eldritch energy, cold chills. 

This power causes the target overwhelming dread and 
horror. The area of effect is the Large Burst Template. Every 
creature beneath the template must make a Fear check, at –2 
if the caster got a raise. Wild Cards who fail roll on the Fear 
Table. Extras are Panicked instead. 

Fly

Rank: Veteran 
Power Points: 3/6 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 3 (1/round) 
Trappings: Gusty winds, wings, broomsticks. 

Fly allows a character to fly at his basic Pace with a Climb 
of 0. He may double his Pace by spending twice the number 
of Power Points. 

. 
Additional Targets: The character may affect up to five 
targets by spending a like amount of additional Power Points. 
Greater Healing

Rank: Veteran 
Power Points: 10/20 
Range: Touch 
Duration: Instant 
Trappings: Laying on hands, touching the victim with a holy 
symbol, praying, giving a drink of water. 

Greater healing restores wounds more than one hour old. 
This use of the power requires 10 Power Points and otherwise 
works exactly like the healing power. It can also be used to 
neutralize any poison, disease, or sickness. 

Greater healing can also heal Permanent Crippling Injuries. 
This requires an arcane skill roll at –4, 1d6 hours of time, and 
20 Power Points. Only one casting is permitted per injury — if 
it fails, the injury really is permanent. 

Growth/Shrink

Rank: Seasoned 
Power Points: 2+ 
Range: Smarts 
Duration: 3 (2/round) 
Trappings: Gestures, words of power, potions. 


Growth 
doubles the overall size of the target. The subject 
gains +1 Size for each 2 Power Points invested when the 
spell is cast. Each step of Size grants the target a one-step 
increase to Strength and a point of Toughness. This spell may 
be cast multiple times on the same target, though the caster 
must track each casting separately. 

Shrink reduces the Size of the subject by one step for each 
2 Power Points, down to a minimum of Size –2 (approximately 
the size of a rat). Each level of Size reduction reduces the 
target’s Strength by one die type (minimum of d4) and his 
Toughness by 1 (minimum of 2). 

Subjects from Size +4 to +7 have the Large ability and fill 
a 2” square on the table-top. From Size +8 to +10, they are 

113 

Huge and occupy an area 3” square. If the target is +11 or 
more, he is considered Gargantuan and occupies a 4” square 
area. Creatures of Size –2 have the Small ability. 

For unwilling targets, the caster’s arcane skill roll is opposed 
by their Spirit. 

Havoc 

Rank: Seasoned 
Power Points: 2 – 4 
Range: Smarts x 2 
Duration: Instant 
Trappings: Whirlwind, chaotic poltergeists, repulsion field. 

While unpredictable, this spell allows a wizard to change 
the field of battle in an instant as targets are thrown in every 
direction. 

With a success, the caster places a Medium Burst Template 
anywhere within range. Any character touched by the template 
must make a Strength roll (at –2 if the caster gets a raise). Any 
target that fails is knocked 2d6” in a random direction (roll a 
d12 and read the result as a clock facing) and becomes prone. 
If the target strikes an inanimate object, he is Shaken as well. 
Targets with cover may subtract the cover modifier from the 
total distance moved (to a minimum of 0), and flying targets 
suffer an additional –2 to their Strength roll. Additionally, roll 
a d6 to see if the flyer is moved toward the ground (1 – 2), 
stays level (3 – 4), or is moved away from the ground (5 – 6). 

. 
Additional Effects: For double the Power Points, havoc 
affects a Large Burst Template. 
Healing

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 3 
Range: Touch 
Duration: Instant 
Trappings: Laying on hands, touching the victim with a holy 
symbol, prayer. 

Healing repairs recent bodily damage. It must be used within 
the “Golden Hour,” though, for it has no effect on wounds 
more than one hour old. 

For Wild Cards, each use of the healing spell removes a 
wound with a success, two with a raise. The roll suffers a 
penalty equal to the victim’s wounds (in addition to any the 
caster might be suffering himself). 

For Extras, the GM must first determine if the ally is 
dead (see Aftermath on page 78). If so, no healing may be 
attempted. If not, a successful arcane skill roll returns the ally 
to the game Shaken. 

Healing can also cure poison and disease if used within 10 
minutes of the event. 

Intangibility

Rank: Heroic 
Power Points: 5 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 3 (2/round) 
Trappings: Ghost form, body of shadow, gaseous 
transformation. 

114 

With a successful arcane skill roll, the user becomes 
incorporeal. He is unable to affect the physical world, and it 
in turn cannot affect him. He can travel through walls, and 
non-magical weapons pass straight through him. Any items 
carried at the time of casting are also incorporeal. 

While incorporeal, the mage may affect other incorporeal 
beings (including himself), and he is still susceptible to magic 
attacks, including physical powers, such as bolt, and magic 
items. 

The character may not become corporeal while within 
someone or something. If that occurs, the caster is instantly 
shunted to the nearest open space, and he is Shaken. 

Invisibility

Rank: Seasoned 
Power Points: 5 
Range: Self 
Duration: 3 (1/round) 
Trappings: Powder, potion, iridescent lights. 

Being invisible is a powerful aid in combat and useful for 
spying on maidens’ changing rooms as well. 

With a success, the character is transparent, but a vague 
outline is visible. A character may detect the invisible presence 
if he has a reason to look and makes a Notice roll at –4. Once 
detected, he may attack the foe at –4 as well. With a raise, 
the character is completely invisible. The penalty to Notice 
or hit him is –6. 

In either case, the power affects the character and his 
personal items. Anything picked up after the power was cast 
remains visible. 

. 
Additional Targets: The character may affect up to five 
targets by spending a like amount of additional Power Points. 
Light/Obscure

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 2 
Range: Smarts 
Duration: 30 minutes (1/10 minutes) or 3 (1/round) 
Trappings: Illusionary torch, sunlight, darkness, thick fogs. 

The ability to affect visibility (create or remove obscurement) 
is a pretty simple but very effective power. 

Light/obscure can be cast on an inanimate object, but if the 
item is in an opponent’s possession, the arcane skill roll is 
opposed by Agility. 

Light negates any darkness/obscurement penalty up to –6 in 
an area equal to a Large Burst Template for 30 minutes (1/10 
minutes). The reverse of the power, obscure, creates a –6 
obscurement penalty of the same size lasting for 3 (1/round). 

Mind Reading

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 3 
Range: Smarts 
Duration: 1 
Trappings: Psionic invasion, soulsight. 

Mind reading allows a character to read another’s thoughts. 
This is an opposed roll versus the target’s Smarts. A success 
allows the character to gain one truthful answer from the 

subject. The target is aware of the mental intrusion unless the 
mind reader gets a raise. The GM may apply modifiers based 
on the subject’s mental Hindrances or current state of mind. 

Pummel 

Rank: Seasoned 
Power Points: 2 
Range: Cone Template 
Duration: Instant 
Trappings: Rippling earth, buffeting winds, rushing waters. 

Pummel allows a character to knock down multiple foes. 
The caster makes an arcane skill roll and then places a 
Cone Template in front of him. Any friend or foe touched by 
the template must make a Strength roll (at –2 if the caster 
gets a raise). Any target that fails is knocked back 2d6” and 
becomes prone. If the target strikes an inanimate object, he 
is Shaken as well. Targets with cover may subtract the cover 
modifier from the total distance moved (to a minimum of 0), 
and flying targets suffer an additional –2 to their Strength roll. 

Puppet

Rank: Veteran 
Power Points: 3 
Range: Smarts 
Duration: 3 (1/round) 
Trappings: Glowing eyes, trance-like state, a swinging pocket 
watch, voodoo dolls. 

Sometimes it pays to persuade others to do your fighting 
for you. Some do this by blatant mind control, others do it 
by manufacturing visual and auditory illusions. Puppet is an 
opposed roll of the character’s arcane skill versus the target’s 
Spirit. The user must score a success and beat the target’s 
roll to gain complete control. The victim will attack friends 
and even commit suicide, though such acts allow the victim 
another opposed Spirit roll to break the spell. 

Quickness 

Rank: Seasoned 
Power Points: 4 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 3 (2/round) 
Trappings: Blurred motion, hyperactivity. 

This power grants incredible swiftness to the recipient. With 
success the target has two separate turns per round on his 
action card instead of the usual one. Each turn is handled 
independently with its own actions, but the character must 
resolve one turn entirely before beginning the second. With 
a raise, the recipient can redraw any initiative cards lower 
than Eight each round. 

Shape Change

Rank: Special 
Power Points: Special 
Range: Self 
Duration: 1 minute (1/minute) 
Trappings: “Morphing,” talismans, tattoos. 

Many cultures have legends of shamans or wizards who 
take on the shape of animals. This power does just that. 
This version of the power only allows a user to transform 
into mundane animals, but more bizarre transmutations may 
be found. 

115 

A character may learn this spell while of Novice Rank but 
cannot transform into the more powerful creatures until 
he attains the appropriate Rank. The cost in Power Points 
depends on the type of creature the character wishes to 
change into. Use the Shape Change table as a guideline for 
unlisted creatures. 

Weapons and other personal effects are assumed into the 
animal’s form and reappear when the power ends, but other 
objects are dropped. 

While transformed, the character retains his own Smarts, 
Spirit, and linked skills (though he may not be able to use 
them since he cannot speak). He gains the animal’s Agility, 
Strength, and linked skills and cannot use most devices. He 
has no capacity for speech and cannot use powers, though he 
may continue to maintain powers previously activated. Vigor 
is the higher of the caster’s or the creature’s. 

The GM has final say on what an animal can and cannot 
do. A shaman in dog-form might be able to pull the trigger 
on a shotgun, for instance, but would use a default skill roll 
of d4–2 as the animal has no Shooting score of its own. The 
shaman’s Persuasion functions normally, but might suffer a 
–4 or worse penalty without speech, depending on what he 
tries to accomplish.

Slow 

Rank: Seasoned 
Power Points: 1 
Range: Smarts x 2 
Duration: 3 (2/round) 
Trappings: Tying a knot in a piece of string, slowing time, 
distracting invisible ghost monkey. 


Skilled fighters and monsters with fast reflexes can strike 
before lesser beings have time to blink. Slowing their reflexes 
reduces their advantage. 

The caster makes an arcane skill roll opposed by the target’s 
Spirit. With a success, movement becomes an action, giving 
the target a multi-action penalty if he wants to move and act in 
the same round. With a raise, the target must redraw initiative 
cards above 10, except Jokers. 

A victim who usually draws multiple initiative cards discards 
only those with a value higher than the spell allows. 

. 
Additional Targets: The character may affect up to five 
targets by spending a like amount of additional Power Points. 
Slumber 

Rank: Seasoned 
Power Points: 2 
Range: Smarts x 2 
Duration: 1 minute (1/minute) 
Trappings: A lullaby, blowing powder or sand at targets. 

Blasting a hoard of enemies into tiny pieces may be popular 
with some mages, but those who favor stealth or have a 
pacifistic bent are drawn to this spell. 

The caster picks where he wants to center the spell and 
places a Medium Burst Template. He then makes an arcane 
skill roll. Any living creature (not undead or constructs) within 
the area must make a Spirit roll, at –2 if the caster scored a 
raise. Those who fail fall asleep. 

Loud noises awaken the sleepers as if they were a normal 
sleeper (Notice roll). When the duration expires, the sleepers 
naturally wake up. 

Smite 

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 2 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 3 (1/round) 
Trappings: A colored glow, runes, sigils, crackling energy, 
barbs grow from the blade. 


This power is cast on a weapon of some sort. If it’s a ranged 
weapon, it affects one entire magazine, 20 bolts, shells, or 
arrows, or one full “load” of ammunition (the GM may have 
to determine the exact quantity for unusual weapons). While 
the spell is in effect, the weapon’s damage is increased by 
+2 or +4 with a raise. 

. 
Additional Targets: The character may affect up to five 
targets by spending a like amount of additional Power Points. 
Speak Language

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 1 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 10 minutes (1/10 minutes) 
Trappings: Words, pictures, hand motions. 

This power allows a character to speak, read, and write a 
language other than his own. The language must be of an 
advanced form — not animalistic. A raise on the arcane skill 
roll allows the user to project a particular dialect as well. 

Speed

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 1 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 3 (1/round) 
Trappings: Blurred motion, “floating,” acrobatics. 

Warriors who need to close with their foes quickly often 
use this power, as do those who sometimes need to outrun 
things Man Was Not Meant to Know. Speed allows the target 
of the power to move faster than usual. With a success, 
the recipient’s basic Pace is doubled. With a raise, running 
becomes a free action, so he may ignore the usual –2 running 
penalty. 

Stun 

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 2 
Range: 12/24/48 
Duration: Special 
Trappings: Bolts of energy, stun bombs, sonic booms, burst 
of blinding light. 

116 

Stun shocks those within a Medium Burst Template with 
concussive force, sound, light, magical energy, or the like. 

If the arcane character scores a success, targets within 
the area of effect must make Vigor rolls or be Shaken. With 
a raise, victims must make Vigor rolls at –2. 

Succor 

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 1 
Range: Touch 
Duration: Instant 
Trappings: Prayer, laying on hands, curative tonic. 

Succor removes one Fatigue level, two with a raise. It can 
also remove a character’s Shaken status. 

Succor may be used to restore consciousness to those who 
have been Incapacitated due to wounds as well, though the 
wounds remain. It does not stop bleeding or otherwise stop 
mortal wounds from worsening, however. 

Summon Ally

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 3+ 
Range: Smarts 
Duration: 3 (1/round) 
Trappings: Call elemental, ghostly dog, dimensional double. 


This power allows the character to summon a loyal and 
obedient servant. On a success, the ally is placed at any point 
within the range of the power. On a raise, the ally is more 
durable and gains the Hardy ability. A summoned ally acts on 
the initiative card of the caster and gets an immediate action 
as soon as it is summoned. 

All Allies are Extras, even Mirror Selves (see below). 

A character may learn this spell while of Novice Rank, but 
he cannot summon more powerful allies until he attains the 
appropriate Rank. The cost in Power Points depends on the 
type of ally the character wishes to summon. Use the Summon 
Ally table as a guideline for unlisted creatures. 

A caster of sufficient Rank to summon more powerful allies 
may instead choose to summon additional lower Rank allies 
instead at the same cost. For each decrease in Rank, he gains 
one additional ally. For example, a Veteran caster could spend 
5 Power Points to summon one Veteran-Rank-allowed ally, 
two Seasoned-Rank-allowed allies, or three Novice-Rankallowed 
allies. Allies summoned by a single casting must all 
be of the same type. 

See the Bestiary for statistics of some of the creatures 
listed below.

Mirror Self 

This is an ally that appears identical to the caster but with 
the following differences. The ally is an Extra as normal for 
the power. The duplicate has half the total Power Points of the 
caster, and all of the duplicate’s Traits are one die type less 
than the caster’s Traits (to a minimum of d4). The duplicate 
has identical mundane equipment, but none of it has any 
magical qualities. 

Telekinesis 

Rank: Seasoned 
Power Points: 5 
Range: Smarts 
Duration: 3 (1/round) 
Trappings: A wave of the hand, magic wand, steely gaze. 

Telekinesis is the ability to move a single object or creature 
(including one’s self) with arcane will. The weight a caster can 
lift is equal to 10 pounds times his Spirit die type, 50 pounds 
times his Spirit with a raise. 

. 
Lifting Creatures: Living targets may resist with an 
opposed Spirit roll. If the roll is greater than the caster’s skill 
total, the victim is unaffected. If the creature loses, however, it 
is lifted as usual and does not get another attempt to break free. 
Occasionally a victim might manage to grab onto something 
solid to prevent itself from being lifted. When this happens, the 
victim may make an opposed Strength roll versus the caster’s 
arcane skill. If the victim is successful, he manages to grab 
onto whatever was available and is not moved, bashed, or 
otherwise affected that round. 

. 
Telekinetic Weapons: A caster can use telekinesis to 
wield a weapon. When this occurs, the weapon’s Fighting 
is equal to his arcane skill, and its damage is based on the 
caster’s Spirit instead of his Strength. A sword that does 
Strength+d6 damage, for example, does Spirit+d6 when 
wielded by telekinesis. The weapon otherwise functions 
normally, including granting bonus damage when it strikes 
with a raise. 
. 
Dropping Things: Particularly ruthless characters often 
use telekinesis to drop their foes or bash them into walls and 
the like. A creature affected by this power can be moved up 
to the caster’s Smarts in inches per turn in any direction. 
Dropped creatures suffer falling damage as usual. 
Victims who are bashed into walls or other solid objects 
suffer the caster’s Spirit+d6 as damage. If a caster with a 
d12 Spirit smashes an orc into a wall, for example, the orc 
suffers d12+d6 damage. 

Teleport

Rank: Seasoned 
Power Points: 3+ 
Range: Special 
Duration: Instant 
Trappings: A cloud of smoke, “phasing” out, change into a 
bolt of lightning. 

Teleport allows a character to disappear and instantly 
reappear up to 10” distant for each 3 Power Points spent, or 
15” with a raise. This counts as his movement for the round. 
Adjacent opponents do not get a free attack against the 
teleporting character. If the hero wishes to teleport somewhere 
he can’t see, he must make a Smarts roll at –2. If it is an 
unknown area he has never seen, the roll is at a –4 penalty. 

Failure of either roll means the teleporter hit an object of 
some sort. He returns where he came from and is Shaken. A 
roll of 1 on the casting die (regardless of the Wild Die) indicates 
a more serious disaster — in addition to being Shaken he also 
suffers 2d6 damage. 

The teleporter can never enter a solid space even if he 
tries. The power instantly returns him to his starting location 
as above. 

. 
Carrying Others: The hero can carry other beings with him 
at the cost of a level of Fatigue per additional “rider.” More than 
two may be carried at once, but causes instant Incapacitation. 
One Fatigue level is regained for each full hour of rest. 
Wall Walker 

Rank: Novice 
Power Points: 2 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 3 (1/round) 
Trappings: A crushed spider, bit of web, piece of tentacle. 

Spellcasters are frequently targeted in combat because of 
their arcane prowess and high-utility spells such as this are 
great for getting the caster safely out of harm’s way. Of course, 
it has countless other uses too. 

Wall walker allows the recipient to function much like a 
human spider. He can stick to any surface, allowing him to 
climb walls and even hang from the ceiling. With a success, 
the character can move along such surfaces at half his normal 
Pace. With a raise, he may move at full Pace and even run. 

. 
Additional Targets: The character may affect up to five 
targets by spending a like amount of additional Power Points. 
Warrior’s Gift 

Rank: Seasoned 
Power Points: 4 
Range: Touch 

118 

Duration: 3 (1/round) 
Trappings: Gestures, prayer, whispered words, concentration. 


Even combat mages cannot afford to spend all their time 
learning new combat maneuvers and martial skills. For 
those who enjoy the thrill of melee or want to improve their 
companions’ skills, this spell provides a quick solution to a 
lack of training. 

With a successful arcane skill roll, the recipient gains the 
benefits of a single Combat Edge chosen by the caster. The 
caster (not the recipient) must be one Rank higher than the 
Rank requirement of the Edge but ignores other requirements, 
even those requiring other Edges. For the duration of the spell, 
the recipient gains all the benefits of the Edge. 

Edges gained through this power provide no additional 
benefit if the character already has the Edge. 

Zombie 

Rank: Veteran 
Power Points: 3/corpse 
Range: Smarts 
Duration: Special 
Trappings: Carving symbols on corpses, throwing bones, 
graveyards, “leather” books. 

This power is considered evil in most settings, and so is 
typically used only by villainous nonplayer characters such 
as necromancers, evil scientists, dark cultists, and the like. 

When cast, zombie raises a number of dead specified by 
the character when he spent his Power Points. The undead 
are immediately obedient, though perhaps a bit mischievous 
and literal-minded in their duties. 

Corpses aren’t summoned by this ability, so there must 
actually be a supply of bodies available for the power to have 
any effect. The bodies don’t have to be fresh — zombie can 
raise servants that have been waiting patiently for centuries. 
Graveyards, morgues, and battlefields can all serve this 
purpose. 

With a success, the dead remain animated for 1 hour. With 
a raise, they remain animated for 1d6 hours. With two raises, 
they remain animated for an entire day. 

Certain powerful necromancers may have improved 
versions of this power that are cheaper to cast and create 
permanent undead. 

Zombie 

These walking dead are typical groaning fiends looking for 
fresh meat. 
Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d4, Spirit d4, Strength d6, 
Vigor d6 
Skills: Fighting d6, Intimidation d6, Notice d4, Shooting d6 
Pace: 4; Parry: 5; Toughness: 7 
Special Abilities 

• 
Claws: Str. 
• 
Fearless: Zombies are immune to Fear and Intimidation. 
• 
Undead: +2 Toughness; +2 to recover from being 
Shaken; called shots do no extra damage (except to 
the head). 
• 
Weakness (Head): Shots to a zombie’s head are +2 
damage.

Chapter Six: 
Game Mastering 
A group of heroes emarks upon an epic quest. Terrible 
monsters and bitter rivals oppose them. The elements are 
against them. Mysteries must be solved, artifacts found, 
innocents saved. 

It’s your job as Game Master to bring all these fantastic 
elements to life, to challenge your players with adventure 
beyond their wildest imaginations, and provide a framework 
to find out if they succeed in their ultimate goal—or fail. 

This is the fun and excitement of being a Game Master— 
of creating, managing, and presenting an entire world of 
excitement and adventure to your closest friends. It can be 
one of the most satisfying entertainment experiences there 
is, and Savage Worlds is designed to help you wring every 
tension-filled moment and gut-busting laugh from it. 

You’ve read the rules and probably have more ideas for a 
new campaign than you know what to do with. Before you do, 
let’s take a moment to talk about the art of being a good Game 
Master, creating worlds, and putting together memorable and 
exciting adventures. 

Learning the Rules

You need to know how to make Trait rolls, use Wild Dice, 
resolve attacks, and handle wounds. Everything else in this 
book, from combat maneuvers to Interludes, can be ignored 
until you need it. 

A great way to do this is to run a very simple fight on your 
own first. Put a Wild Card fighter and three orcs on the table 
in front of you and have at it. Your only goal is to get a feel 
for rolling the dice, figuring totals from Aces and modifiers, 
rolling and applying damage, Soaking wounds. If you can 
handle that, you can run a game. 

Your Game 

You might think that the first step in starting a new game is 
finding a group of people to play with. That is important, but 
that’s your next step. Your first step is to get yourself excited. 
Do that and you’ll likely get all your friends excited as well. 

Start by figuring out what kind of setting you want to run. 
What kind of characters might people play? What might a 
typical adventure be like? Jot down a few notes about what 
makes your game cool, who the bad guys are, what kinds of 
magic or other supernatural aspects are present, and what 
your basic storyline is. If you have these elements, you’ve 
got enough information to “sell” your game to your friends 
and get them to play. 

Game Night

Now it’s time to recruit. You’ve got a great campaign idea 
and enough information about it to explain it to your friends. 
The next step is to find out who wants to play, and when they 
can do it. 

When you’re finding out who wants to play, first ask when 
each person can make it. It’s very important that you set both 
a time and a regular day to play. If you rely on a fluctuating 
week-to-week schedule, you’re almost certainly doomed to 
failure. People have busy lives, and as much as everyone 
involved might love to play, they’ve still got to study for classes, 
take care of their children, and otherwise live their lives. If you 
have a set night every week, it’s much easier for your friends 
to schedule most of their activities around game night. It also 
helps you know when you’ve got to be ready to run. 

Don’t rule out playing on weeknights. Friday and Saturday 
are great if you’re single or in college, but difficult for players 
who need weekend nights to be with their families. If you start 

120 

at 6 p.m., your players have time to get off work, grab some 
food (or share pizza with the group), and get deep into the 
game by 7 or so. 

For most groups, you should wrap things up by 11 p.m. or 
so. Most people tend to get a little tired by then and you don’t 
want game night to be a stressful experience. Talk it over with 
the group and see what works for them. Setting some basic 
rules will help everyone schedule and makes it far more likely 
everyone will show up week after week. 

A wise Game Master tries to end each night with a bit of a 
cliffhanger as well. If your players are talking during the week 
about what’s going to happen next, you’ve done your job well. 

Character Types

Once you’ve got a few friends interested, it’s great if you can 
give them a little primer information and find out what kind of 
characters they want to play. You don’t need everyone to make 
characters at this point—character creation is fast enough that 
they can do it at your first session if you want. But if some of 
your friends have neat ideas as to their background or basic 
type (fighter, investigator, etc.), you can start doing more 
detail work on your story. If you’re going to run Evernight, for 
example, and all your friends make combat types, you know 
they’re looking for a high-action, “hack and slash” type game. 
That doesn’t mean you can’t mix in lots of other elements— 
exploration, horror, deep roleplaying, and so on—but every 
now and then you’ll want to have a big nasty combat as well. 

Getting the Party Together 

The first thing you need to do in any new adventure or 
campaign is figure out why the characters are together. There 
are two common ways to handle this. 

The Mission 

The most common way of building a party is for an employer 
to offer a reward for adventurers to complete some task. 
Perhaps they answer a want ad, are hired in a smoky tavern, 
or are called on by connections or friends. Either way, the 
heroes are then thrown together by fate and must learn to 
work as a team. 

There’s a problem that sometimes arises from this approach. 
Say you’re running a fantasy campaign and the mission is to 
deliver a message to a distant city. But one of the characters 
in your group is a witch hunter. His player is all excited about 
making such a unique character, but you need him (and the 
others) to be a courier for now and accept the assignment to 
kick off your campaign. 

Fortunately, there’s an easy way to fix this. Instead of 
arguing with the player about his character’s motivations, 
let the player figure it out. Be honest and tell him that this is 
what you need to get things started. Maybe the witch hunter 
is simply between jobs. Or maybe he’s working under cover 
to root out some evil sorceress, or needs to earn some gold 
to buy better arms and equipment for his task. Or maybe the 
employer or the recipient is an old friend (or enemy). 

This approach not only helps get things moving, but may 
establish an entirely new and interesting subplot for your 
campaign! 

Former Acquaintances

You can also start a campaign with all the characters already 
knowing each other. This works great for getting the game 
moving, and is very appropriate for certain campaign types. 
Weird Wars games in particular, for example, are often best 
run where the soldiers have served together for a bit and know 
at least the basic faults and vices of their companions. This 
is also a great way to kick off a convention game where your 
group only has a few hours to play. 

The downside of starting a campaign like this is that some 
players may feel cheated if they put a lot of work into their 
characters’ backgrounds. Players often come up with deep 
backstories for their heroes. This shows great imagination 
and enthusiasm for your game and should be encouraged. 

Unfortunately, unless you’ve set the character up as an 
important person in your setting and his background figures 
prominently in the events that are to come, it’s very likely all 
that work will never come to light. The reason why is that 
individual backgrounds likely aren’t part of your overall plot, 
and characters don’t engage in revealing small talk like real 
people do. (But see Interludes on page 91!) 

Staying Together 

After the first adventure, the players may wonder exactly 
why their characters might stay together. This is easy if they’re 
employed by a common benefactor, or if similar groups are 
common to the setting (adventuring crews, military teams, 
and so on). 

Staying together might be more difficult if the campaign goal 
isn’t very clear, or if some of the characters don’t get along that 
well. How to fix this depends a lot on the type of game you’re 
running. If there’s a clear, overall objective or over-arching 
storyline, the party might stay together to defeat the greater 
evil, even if they aren’t the best of friends. 

If the campaign goal is more ambiguous, the best answer 
may be to not force the heroes to stay together. Consider a 
modern horror game. The players are thrust together in a 
haunted mansion for a weekend. Terrible things occur, but 
eventually at least some of the player characters survive 
and stagger back into daylight. Why would they then go out 
hunting vampires or searching for zombies the following week 
just because they had one incredible encounter? 

Maybe they don’t. Maybe they all go home and try to forget 
what happened just like normal folks. Let a few days or 
weeks of nothing happen (narratively, of course). Later on 
though, one of the characters gets involved in another creepy 
encounter. This time out, however, he knows at least a few 
other people who won’t laugh at him or throw him in the loony 
bin, so he calls and asks the other player characters for help. 

Friction 

So what happens if your group doesn’t get along? That 
depends on whether it’s the players or the characters who 
are arguing. 

We won’t give you advice on how to handle conflicts with 
your friends. You know them best, and will have to figure out 
if there are certain friends who just don’t fit in your campaign. 

121 

Remember though that friends are more important than 
games—even ours. If you and the rest of the group can’t talk 
out your differences, find something else to do for a while that 
doesn’t cause such friction. Maybe you can come back to the 
game once you’ve worked things out. 

Friction between characters, on the other hand, is not only 
fine, it’s actually encouraged to some degree. Any interesting 
group of personalities squabble and argue on occasion. As 
long as this is done in character, it adds to the roleplaying 
experience and the depth of your campaign. Quiet fights 
between the heroes can often take on a life of their own, 
encouraging players to take you, the Game Master, aside or 
write you private notes about actions their heroes perform 
away from the prying eyes of others. 

Campaign Types 

Different groups like different types of games. Some like 
lots of combat, others prefer to run fast and loose with more 
roleplaying and less “hack and slash.” Most people mix all 
these elements together. When you cut to the chase, there are 
basically three campaign types: Hack and Slash, Roleplaying, 
and Exploration. 

Hack and Slash 

A Hack and Slash game features lots of combat. With 
Savage Worlds, you can do more than pit your five player 
characters against a couple of orcs and an ogre. You can 
throw a whole horde at your heroes, and give them a few 
staunch allies or henchmen to help as well! 

The best part is that players who just want to wade into the 
forces of darkness with two blades slashing can do it. More 
tactically-minded players can load up on Leadership Edges 
and direct the actions of hirelings and allies. 

Players who like to think on their feet can take advantage 
of acrobatic maneuvers and the like to describe their heroes’ 
actions down to the most minute details. 

Exploration

Exploring lost cities, finding forgotten treasures, or reclaiming 
fallen civilizations is always exciting for the players. The Great 
Unknown lurks behind every pile of toppled columns, and 
Incredible Treasures await those brave enough to take them 
from their mysterious guardians. 

The trouble with exploration games is that they’re often 
difficult for you, the Game Master, to create. All those incredible 
surprises, fearsome beasts, and awesome treasures have to 
be created by you. Fortunately, Savage Worlds makes it easy 
to quickly create just about any creature, magic item, or other 
surprise you can dream up. 

One important tip here. The players don’t have access to 
your creatures’ statistics unless you give it to them. If you 
describe mysterious creatures of different shapes and sizes, 
don’t kill yourself trying to make their statistics vastly different. 

Roleplaying

Perhaps the trickiest type of campaign to run is one that 
involves deep roleplaying. It’s very easy to handle rules-
wise—there likely won’t be much die rolling besides a few 

122 

Persuasion rolls here and there. The tricky part is handling all 
the different Extras and interacting with the player characters. 
Again, being able to create characters on the fly helps 
tremendously here. You can jot down a few notes about a 
character’s most important skills and then move on. That way 
you can concentrate on giving your Extras more personality 
and worry less about how good they are at obscure skills. 

Another thing to be careful of when running a game that’s 
heavy on roleplaying is making sure there are at least a few 
events scheduled to give the group something to talk about. If 
the majority of your adventure is a bunch of people standing 
in a room, you’re likely in for a slow night. If they’re in a room 
trying to find out which one of them is a murderer, the action 
will likely be quite exciting. And if the lights occasionally go 
out and another victim turns up dead, the interaction between 
characters can easily get as exciting as the most knock-down, 
drag-out dungeon crawl. 

Horror 

Most every game has an element of horror to it. New Game 
Masters often ask how to handle horror in their games. They 
have visions in their heads of their friends sitting around 
shivering in utter terror as gruesome fiends stalk their 
underpowered investigators. 

Unfortunately, that’s not too likely. There may certainly be 
moments like that, but more likely, your group will be sitting 
around eating nachos and making bad jokes to each other 
most of the night. The worst thing you can do is try and stop 
them. Remember that they’re there to have a good time and 
socialize while exercising their own imaginations. Let them 
enjoy themselves and don’t try to be overly oppressive with 
the spooky stuff. 

When the time comes and the weirdness begins, subtly 
change the tone a bit. Smile and dim the lights, then turn 
on some creepy music—just loud enough for them to hear it 
without being too overt. If what you’re running is genuinely 
creepy, your group will be relaxed and willing to go with the 
flow and let the heebie-jeebies take over. Try and force them 
and it will almost certainly backfire. 

Whatever you do, when the group finally encounters some 
horrid monster, make sure to describe it rather than refer to 
it by name. A “large, lanky, green-skinned creature with drool 
dripping from its fangs and beady black eyes” is much more 
frightening than “a troll.” 

Running the Game 

Savage Worlds has been designed from the ground up to 
make the job of the Game Master as easy as possible. The 
designers and playtesters of this game want to concentrate 
on playing the game and making incredible and exciting 
memories. We aren’t interested in spending hours before the 
game creating statistics for Karlos the Innkeeper. 

That means that when preparing for your game, you can 
concentrate on creating intricate plots, tricky puzzles, and 
interesting characters. You don’t have to do complex math 
to make your nonplayer characters and monsters, and you 

certainly don’t need to spend an hour on some computer 
program just to make up a few bandits. 

Your job is kept easy during the game as well since there’s 
very little bookkeeping. You might have to track a few Wild 
Card villains’ wounds, but other than that, the bad guys are up, 
Shaken, or removed from play. You can focus on describing 
the action instead of trying to record “2 hit points of damage 
on the skeleton figure with the chipped paint on his sword.” 

Take advantage of these things to give yourself a break and 
run a game like you never have before. If you want to spend 
a lot of time on your campaign, make some cool props or 
develop your nonplayer characters’ personalities and plots— 
not their game statistics. 

Introducing New Players 

Getting your friends to try a new game, especially if they’re 
used to one system and don’t like to try many others, can be 
pretty difficult. We recommend downloading the Test Drive 
rules from our website and giving them to each of your friends. 
This will show them what Savage Worlds is all about and 
encourage them to try it at least once. If you run one of the 
free adventures from our site, complete with pregenerated 
characters, it should be very easy for everyone to jump in, 
play a short session, and figure out if it’s for them. We hope 
it is of course. If so, you can then try something with a little 
more meat, such as Deadlands, Necessary Evil, Slipstream, 
or even a world of your own creation. If you like these rules 
but have a favorite game world, you can convert it over (see 
page 128). 

Balance 

Some games have very strict rules for how to balance 
encounters so that every fight is “fair.” The battle might be a 
tough one, but it’s still expected the heroes can win if they 
play smart and have decent luck. 

In Savage Worlds, most setpiece encounters should be 
reasonably balanced for the expected power level of the 
group. But this isn’t always the case. Sometimes it’s just as 
interesting for the players to evaluate a situation and realize 
they probably can’t win—at least not by charging in guns 
blazing. This is desirable on occasion as it encourages the 
group to think, talk, plan, and come up with clever solutions 
to the most challenging situations. 

Game Masters should never be afraid to let the opposition 
flex their muscles. These are savage worlds, after all, 
and triumphing against these foes should be a major 
accomplishment—not a given. 

Combat Ratings

Once you’ve played Savage Worlds for a while you should 
have a good feel for how many bad guys to throw at your 
adventurers. New Game Masters might want a little guidance. 
The system below gives you a baseline to start from, but make 
sure to also think about additional advantages either side 
might have (such as traps, support, powerful magic items, or 
favorable terrain). 

123 

Bennies


• 
Start your estimate by getting a Combat Rating for each 
player character equal to half the maximum damage he 
does with his typical attack. So a fighter with a d8 Strength 
and a short sword (Str+d6 damage) has a Damage Rating 
of 7 (14/2). A wizard who typically uses the bolt power 
averages a standard bolt attack of 2d6, or 6 (12/2). 
• 
Add +1 for each Combat Edge or special ability, and 
another +1 for each point of Toughness over 5. 
• 
Do the same for any allies. If a character isn’t a Wild 
Card, his Combat Rating is halved. 
• 
Now add all the player characters’ Combat Ratings 
together to find the party’s Combat Rating. 
• 
Use the same system for the villains (counting combat 
special abilities as Combat Edges). 
Now compare each side’s values. If the party’s Combat 
Rating is 50, for example, your opposition should be a little less 
for an easy encounter, about even for a moderate encounter, 
and a little more for a tough fight. 

If the villains’ Combat Rating is two or more times the heroes’ 
total they’re likely going to learn how to retreat. 

Experience 

You should usually award two experience points per game 
session. That means your players get to upgrade their 
characters every two or three game. 

When you end longer adventures, story arcs that take four to 
six sessions or so, you might want to award three points, but 
any more should be reserved for really big events. Keeping 
your average award to two means your characters progress 
at a more natural rate, and won’t be Legendary warriors after 
only a few months of play. 

Starting With Experienced Characters

In general, player characters at the start of Savage Worlds 
campaigns have a little training and talent, but haven’t had 
many adventures on their own yet. 

You may occasionally want to start a campaign with more 
experienced characters. That’s encouraged for really difficult 
worlds, or for shorter campaigns where the heroes need to 
get to the heart of the action a little quicker. A commando raid 
in World War Two, an assault on a lich’s lair, or super spies 
infiltrating a diabolical villain’s base are not adventures for 
the inexperienced. 

Start experienced characters as Seasoned, or very rarely, 
Veterans, when first trying this out. Once you have a good 
feel for more experienced characters, you can go as high as 
you want. 

It’s important to the balancing process to make your players 
create their characters as Novices and then “bump” them up 
through their four progressions per Rank. That maintains a 
more realistic progression of attributes and skills, and ensures 
they can’t take more advanced Edges than they would 
otherwise be entitled to. 

It’s also easier to do it this way from a player’s perspective. 
It’s a little tricky to add up all the “points” one would have at 
Seasoned rank. Bump up a character from a Novice however 
and the advancement system is very simple. 

Experience is very limited—we encourage you to give out 
two points just about every game session. Bennies are much 
more flexible, and allow you to reward creative players on the 
spot for their actions. 

You should hand out a Benny anytime a player does 
something particularly clever, finds a very important clue, 
or generally advances the plot. You should also hand out 
Bennies for great roleplaying, particularly as it concerns their 
Hindrances. If a Loyal character jeopardizes his life to save 
his comrade, he definitely deserves a Benny for his efforts. It 
never hurts to reward a player for a great line, side-splitting 
in-game joke, or even a rare serious and dramatic moment. 

Average players should get one or two extra Bennies per 
night. Really good roleplayers may wind up with two to three. 

Interpret the Die Rolls 

Savage Worlds frequently features wild and unpredictable 
die rolls. When this happens, go with it! If a hero has to jump 
from a wrecked car as it careens out of control and makes an 
amazing Agility roll, describe how he leaps into the air, tucks 
and rolls on the ground, and comes up on his feet with perfect 
balance. Similarly, don’t be afraid to throw some bad luck at 
them when they get a really poor roll. Maybe while using the 
Chase rules a player is skiing down a mountain attempting 
to escape a rampaging yeti and rolls snake eyes! Describe 
how he tumbles in the snow, rolling and tumbling as the beast 
bounds after him and prepares to make its attack! 

Your players will love the extra embellishment, and they’ll 
feel powerful and cool when the dice are nice, and feel danger 
and excitement when the dice betray them. 

Pacing 

A good Game Master must pay attention to the pace of 
the game. Sometimes your group will want to take their time 
roleplaying their characters, interacting with the world, or even 
just joking out of character and enjoying the social aspect of 
the game. If this goes on too long, however, your party likely 
needs a little guidance. 

This can be especially true in open adventures such as a 
murder mystery that requires the players to figure out where 
their characters go and what they want to do (as opposed to 
a dungeon crawl or similar adventure where they really only 
need to decide if they’re pressing forward or not). 

In general, if most or all of the group is roleplaying, smiling, 
and having a good time—leave them alone. Let them set 
them the pace. If you notice some of your players are left out 
or looking a little bored, prod them a bit. If they seem a little 
lost as to what to do next, ask one of the group to recount 
the clues or situation as they understand it. This will often be 
enough to spark an idea or lead they want to follow up on. You 
might also introduce new information via a call or visit from 
a nonplayer character. Finally, don’t be afraid to contrive an 
encounter that gives the group a new path to follow. Maybe 
the team is attacked by the bad guys, and in the aftermath 
are able to gather a new clue from the survivors. 

124 

Combat Pacing

Perhaps even more important than pacing at the plot level 
is making sure combats are fast and furious. As you count 
down the Action Cards, make each player tell you what his 
character is doing fairly quickly. If he needs a moment, put 
his character on Hold and move on to the next player (but 
probably wait if the next actor is a villain). 

If you feel the scene should be particularly dramatic and a 
player doesn’t announce his character’s intentions quickly 
enough, start counting down… “What do you do? 5, 4, 3…!” 
That will get all the players’ blood pumping and reinforce the 
notion that their characters are in a dangerous situation that 
requires quick decisions and big heroics. 

Design Note - The Countdown 
The countdown is a fantastic tool for instilling a sense 

of urgency into your combats. We’ve run hundreds of 

games and when a player takes too long to figure out 
what they want to do on their turn everyone suffers. 
That’s not to say there aren’t times when you want to 
give them some breathing room—particularly if they 

have a big plan or need to look up something really 
important. But most of the time, rush things along. 
Make them feel the urgency of combat. Make them a 
little nervous. Make them realize things are desperate 
and that next die roll better be a good one. 

And of course, don’t be afraid to back off and give 
the group time to plan and strategize when that 

makes sense. Feel the moment and play up the 

drama befitting your scenario, the environment, and 

the party’s mood. 

Extras 

The backbone of any good game is the world that surrounds 
the player characters, and nonplayer characters are a big part 
of that. This section shows you how to breathe life into the 
supporting cast of your world. 

Creating Extras

Consider this Game Master’s Rule #1 when it comes to 
Extras: Don’t “build” them! 

Don’t create your Extras with the character creation rules. 
Just give them what you think they ought to have in their 
various skills and attributes and move on. Remember this 
game is supposed to be easy for you to set up, run, and 
play. Don’t sit around adding up skill points for Extras when 
you could be designing fiendish traps and thinking up nasty 
special abilities for your monsters! 

Personality

Far more important than most nonplayer character’s 
statistics are their personalities. Jot down a note or two about 
any Extras the party is likely to come across so you’ll have 
some idea how to run them. Some Game Masters find it useful 
to identify prominent Extras with actors or characters from 
film, television, books, or comics. 

Knowing that the Captain of the City Guard is “played by 
Sam Elliot,” for instance, gives you a good handle on how 
to handle interactions with him. He’s likely to be gruff, to the 
point, and have a deep, throaty voice. 

Adding these extra touches to the characters can really 
make them stand out and be remembered by your players as 
well. That way the captain becomes a memorable character 
they may call on in the future rather than just a one-shot 
resource they forget about by the next scene. Not every Extra 
needs this kind of depth of course, but those that do add a 
level of realism and continuity to your game. 

Allies 

Though it’s rarely written, most games assume that the 
Game Master controls the nonplayer characters, both when 
they’re being talked to and when they fight alongside the 
player characters in combat. Most of the time, this means the 
overworked GM simply forgets about the additional characters 
during a fight, or shoves them off to the side and narratively 
describes what happens to them. This goes for hirelings as 
well as animal companions, sidekicks, or love interests. The 
simple fact is that in most games, allies are a cumbersome 
complication. 

Savage Worlds takes a very different approach—we turn 
control of allies over to the player characters. The GM acts out 
these allies when they’re spoken to, of course, but he should 
very rarely, if ever, take them over in combat. 

If you allow your heroes to have allies, you can include all the 
minions your villains should have as well. Picture an ancient 
lich cornered in his unholy “throne” room. Would he be sitting 
there alone? No, he’d be surrounded by scores of ghoulish 
undead. These lesser minions make great complications for 
your battles, and your players will have fun bashing through 
them with the Extras while their heroes battle the lich and his 
more capable lieutenants. 

This can take a little getting used to. If you’ve been Game 
Mastering other games for a long time and have a hard time 
letting go of the nonplayer characters, we suggest you try it 
for a bit and see how it works out. You can always change it 
if doesn’t make sense for your group. 

Artificial Inflation 

When running Savage Worlds, a lot of Game Masters 
become extremely enamored with the ally aspect of the game. 
That’s great and it’s what we intend, but it also sometimes 
leads to very large parties of player characters and Extras, 
which then demand very large parties of opponents. 

It’s okay if you do this—the system can handle it—but 
be warned that a combat with 50+ combatants will take a 
bit, even with a fast and furious system. To avoid this kind 
of “inflation,” pay attention to the size of your party and its 
nonplayer characters, and then remember that you’ll need a 
lot of enemies to challenge a large group.

Creating Worlds 
Pinnacle makes many incredible and award-winning settings 
that we hope you’ll check out, but it’s also fun to create your 
own worlds to play in. The game rules and statistics won’t give 
you any trouble after you’ve played even a single game, and 
you probably don’t need to create a single Edge, Hindrance, 
or power (though you may want to). That means you can 
concentrate on what your world is about, what the heroes do 
there, what kinds of fantastic treasures they might find, and 
who their opponents are. 

The Name 

It’s not necessarily the most important part of the game, 
but a good name can really help you nail down the theme. 
Evernight, for example, is about a world of perpetual darkness. 
Deadlands has a Western feel, and hints at the underlying 
horror. You can just guess what Hell on Earth is all about. 

If you can come up with a good name for your game, it may 
help everyone instantly realize just what kind of setting it is. 

Iconic Adventures 

Perhaps the single strongest thing you can think of for your 
new world is what you expect a typical adventure to be about. 
If it’s a fantasy “dungeon crawler,” you expect the heroes 
to delve into multi-leveled dungeons fighting monsters and 
gathering treasure. If it’s an anti-corporate cyberpunk setting, 
you expect the team to run missions against secure buildings 
and battle in cyberspace. 

This doesn’t mean all your adventures need to follow this 
pattern, but if you set this as a baseline expectation players 
will quickly understand the world, what it’s about, and most 
importantly, their role in it. Knowing the game will mostly be 
about Texas Rangers roaming the frontier fighting crime, for 
example, gives a player a very strong guideline for what kind 
of character he could make. 

Scripted Adventures

Scripted adventures are more like interactive stories. The 
players can make choices along the way, but the overall plot 
advances more or less intact regardless of what they do. Epic 
tales must sometimes follow this path—it’s hard to tell a story 
if you don’t know what chapters are to come. 

When running a scripted adventure, try not to make your 
scenarios feel scripted. The group should never feel like 
they’re just observers, going along for the ride no matter what 
they do. Instead, use the situation, overwhelming opponents, 
or “down times” to give the group the illusion they control the 
story more than they really do. In Evernight, for example, 
there’s a point where the heroes can do whatever they want 
for a time. Eventually, however, they are captured by the 
villains of the tale, and begin the next episode of the story. 

Situational Adventures 

Situational adventures are much easier to run if you’re 
able to think on your feet as you won’t have quite as much 
preparation. In these epic tales, you present a situation of 
some sort and then just let the heroes deal with it however they 

choose. Say an evil lich has risen and is creating an army of 
undead to destroy the living. What do the heroes do about it? 
Do they hire on with the local militia? Do they try and sneak 
into the cursed lands to strike down the necromancer himself? 

You will need to prepare a few locations, Extras, and perhaps 
a few staged encounters ahead of time. You don’t want to 
have to figure out what the lich’s lair looks like on the fly, for 
example. And you might want a few “random” encounters to 
fill in the gaps between the heroes’ actions. 

The Genre 

Your setting should hint at what genre it’s in—you shouldn’t 
pick a genre and then try to shoehorn your setting into it. 
Maybe you want to make a pulp fantasy game that harkens 
back to the old Robert E. Howard Conan® stories. You could 
call that pulp, but most people will think you’re talking about 
Indiana Jones® or The Shadow®. Call it fantasy and they’ll 
think you’re talking about Tolkien or Dungeons & Dragons®. 

So how about “pulp fantasy?” That tells your friends that 
there’s not likely to be lots of shining knights on white horses 
saving princesses. It’s more likely to feature cunning rogues 
outwitting incredibly powerful sorcerers, lost races, forgotten 
ruins, and savage combat. 

Having a genre description in your head can go a long way 
toward helping you figure out what kinds of villains should be 
present, and what typical adventures your characters might 
go on. 

The World 

Now it’s time to design the world itself. Start with the area 
you expect the heroes to adventure in most of the time. If 
there’s a city that serves as their home base, describe it in a 
paragraph or two. Is it a shining example of law and order? 
Or is it a wretched hive of scum and villainy? Now sketch out 
some of the surrounding areas. Are the “Mountains of Dread” 
just a few miles away? Or are such places relatively far away 
from the centers of population? 

There are several software programs available to help you 
do this if you like. The nice thing about using a computer 
program is that it’s much easier to make changes should 
you later decide the Mountains of Dread were just too close. 
Or perhaps the players themselves can add to the map in 
exploration campaigns as they discover new areas and lost 
cities! 

Original Settings

When creating your own original setting, start by identifying 
its core elements. Spend some time writing down just what 
makes it so special. What are the themes? Is it fantasy? Is it 
science fiction? Is it science fantasy? Is there a hook? If so, 
what is it? (And we highly recommend you have a hook—there 
are already solid swords and sorcery realms with elves and 
dwarves. Add something new, like an alien invasion—as we 
did in Evernight.) 

Once you have clearly identified the thematic elements that 
identify your setting, figure out who the heroes are. These 
“archetypes” are usually the best identifiers of new worlds. 

127 

Next figure out what kind of adventures take place. There’s 
no point detailing the undersea world of Caribdus, for example, 
if 99% of the action in 50 Fathoms takes place above water 
and on ships. Focus your efforts where it’s important, then fill 
in the extra details when they come up. 

The last step you should take is creating new powers, Edges, 
and Hindrances. For the most part, we’ve found you really 
want to keep the selection to less than a dozen powers, and 
half that number of new Edges or Hindrances. A lot of new 
Game Masters go crazy creating scores of each, but at the 
end of the day find that most of the stuff people actually take 
is already covered in the main Savage Worlds rule book. 
That’s not to say you shouldn’t have some cool new powers, 
Edges, or Hindrances—just that you should think them 
through very carefully, and add them mostly for flavor or to 
cover some very unique feature of the setting that the rules 
don’t currently cover. 

Converted Settings

There are literally thousands of great roleplaying settings 
out there made by other companies besides Pinnacle. We’re 
fans of many of these brilliant worlds as well. But we usually 
like playing them with Savage Worlds. Here are some tips 
we’ve learned after a few years of watching folks “savage” 
other games. 

Don’t reinvent the wheel. Savage Worlds was designed 
for quick play with minimal rule interference. All too often 
conversions of other games try to account for every element— 
massive skill lists, minute details, and hundreds of powers. 

This isn’t Savage Worlds, and bringing in those elements is 
likely to burden the rules to the point where the game play is 
no longer fast, furious, or fun. 

Like an original setting, identify the themes of the other 
game and try to adapt with a very few key world rules. Literal 
translations of game mechanics from other systems usually 
just result in cumbersome sub-systems that don’t add one 
minute of fun to the Savage version. 

There is a often a strong desire to create lots of new skills, 
Edges, and powers to fit your setting. That’s understandable, 
but it isn’t always the best path. 

Remember that more skills dilutes the pool from which the 
players can choose. It weakens the overall character, because 
now their 15 skill points have to be spread further. Creating 
a list of 20 different firearm skills might be more realistic, but 
the system wasn’t designed that way and it becomes a major 
burden to the players. Creating one new Edge that allows a 
person to specialize in a specific gun is a better way to go 
if that’s particularly important to the feel of your game (as it 
might be in a high-tech military campaign). 

Remember too that a lot of what you’re looking for might 
already be in the rules. Do you need a sniper Edge? That’s 
Marksman. Do you need a Mechanic skill? Why not use 
Repair? Do you need a magic missile power? Why not use 
bolt? 

When you do decide to add a new skill, try to let it cover as 
broad a range of related topics as possible. There’s no need 

to create Dancing, Oratory, Acting, and Singing Skills 
in most campaigns when a single Perform skill 
does the trick. 

When converting monsters and Extras, compare 
them to existing creatures in this rule book. That’s 
much easier—and much less confining—than trying 

to convert every attribute, skill, and hit point. 

Design Note - The Elevator Pitch 

There’s a term used in Hollywood called “the 

Elevator Pitch.” The idea is that you’re a young and 

hungry screenwriter trying to pitch an idea to an 

executive. You can’t get in to see him, but one day 

he’s in the elevator and you have about 30 seconds 
to make him understand your idea, why it’s cool, and 
why he’d want to make it. 

The idea of the elevator pitch is strong for your 

campaign as well. If it takes many minutes to explain 
what the game is about to your potential players, it’s 

too much. You can certainly do all the things you’ve 
talked about or have them as part of your backstory, 
but they need to be revealed during play as they’re 
important to the characters. 

If your game can be summed up succinctly, the 

players will get it quickly as well. You’ll also know very 
quickly if they’re excited about it and then can ask you 

for the details they’re particularly interested in. 

Here are the elevator pitches for some of Pinnacle’s 
games: 

128 

• 
Deadlands: Weird Western horror where heroes are 
sometimes so tough they come back from the dead. 
• 
50 Fathoms: A fantastic and colorful world is drowning 
from a witch’s curse. Heroes from that world and our 
own earth must travel the seas to stop the flooding and 
defeat the witches. 
• 
Necessary Evil: When all the superheroes are gone, the 
only ones left to save the world from an evil alien invasion 
are the supervillains! 
• 
Weird Wars: The violence of war gives rise to dark things. 
Soldiers, sailors, and airmen of every nation must battle 
their enemies as well as the horrible things that grow in 
the shadows. 
Races 

A race of super-intelligent titans are simply going to be more 
powerful in game terms than humans. That’s fine if everyone 
is playing a titan, but if they’re not, the GM needs to do a little 
balancing. 

Guidelines for creating new player character races can be 
found on page 22, but if the entire campaign world is more 
difficult (or less difficult), don’t be afraid to amp up (or tone 
down) the heroes. 

Perhaps the player characters are all giant monsters, as 
are their foes. Or perhaps the heroes are intelligent rats. 
Both campaigns could be extremely interesting—and require 
stronger or weaker starting statistics. 

New Edges & Hindrances 

Now comes one of the trickiest parts of the game. You may 
want to create some new Edges & Hindrances for your setting. 
First, realize that you probably don’t have to. What’s in this 
book covers an awful lot of character types. 

What you really may want to look at are Professional Edges. 
These help you create the archetypal characters of your world. 
A Savage Worlds character with the Woodsman Edge, for 
example, is a “ranger” in most swords and sorcery games. 

If there’s a particular character type common to your world, 
this is the way to encourage your group to play them. Let’s say 
you’re creating a far-future Matrix-type world with vampires, 
for example, and you want to create one or more Professional 
Edges for vampire hunters. You could start with something 
useful but fairly low-powered, let’s call it Hunter. These are 
guys who know the vampires exist and have fought them 
before. Maybe their special ability is that they never make 
Fear checks when confronted by vampires. To reflect the fact 
that they’ve had to face them before, you set the requirement 
as Novice, Fighting d8+, and Spirit of d8+. 

Maybe later on, you create Vampire Hunter. These guys 
have learned how to stake the bloodsuckers in the heart, and 
halve penalties for such called shots. Maybe an improved 
version negates the penalty altogether. 

If there’s a cardinal rule to Edges, it’s that you don’t want to 
grant flat bonuses to combat or arcane skills. It’s okay if they 
only apply in certain situations, but don’t give gunslingers +2 
to Shooting all the time, or martial artists +2 to Fighting all 
the time. You’ll really throw off the scale of the game if you 

do that, particularly as they reach higher Ranks. You can give 
them flat bonuses to noncombat skills, but be careful not to 
stack them too high with those already found in this book. 

Finally, don’t feel you need a ton of new Edges & Hindrances. 
What you’re looking for is those few bits that make the world 
stand out, or enable a particular character archetype to 
function more effectively than he could if the new rules weren’t 
there. It’s not a good idea to go scouring every other book 
we’ve done and import all the Combat Edges into your world— 
it’s overwhelming to the players, unnecessary, and moves the 
game away from what it’s supposed to be: streamlined fun. 


Design Note - Less Is More 
We’ve seen hundreds of new settings now, both those 
which have been published by fans and licensees as 
well as submissions that have never gone public. One 
thing we see way too much is the “everything and 
the kitchen sink” approach. It’s overwhelming and it 
just doesn’t make sense. Does your Cthulhu-inspired 

1920s campaign really need all the Combat Edges 

from Weird Wars? Does your expedition to Mars really 

need all the Professional Edges from 50 Fathoms? 

Sometimes less is more. Use the core book and 

anything you just can’t live without. For everything 

else, let the players decide if they want it. Then you 

can allow it, or not. 

Trim the Fat! 

Now that you have your theme and your mechanics are in 
place, it’s time to go back and get rid of the stuff that doesn’t 
fit or isn’t needed. Does your fantasy setting really need elves 
and dwarves? Or did you include them because every fantasy 
setting since The Hobbit® has them? Would anything be lost 
by their removal? Could something else take their place? Do 
you really need those extensive computer rules in a sci-fi 
setting? Star Trek® might need extensive computer rules— 
Star Wars® does not. Even then, a Knowledge (Computer 
Use) skill probably does everything you need. 

Final Note 

At all times, remember to keep it “FFF”—or Fast, Furious, 
and Fun! All progress in creating a setting should further the 
setting’s feel, but never at the expense of FFF. These are 
some of the lessons we think work for most people and most 
settings, and have been echoed on our forums and listservs 
since Savage Worlds came out in March of 2003. But it’s 
your game, and you need to decide what works best for you. 

We’ve talked about heroes and their antics. Now it’s time 
to deal with the monsters, villains, and bad guys. Below are 
some abilities common to many monsters and villains. 

Nonplayer characters and monsters can have any regular 
Edges or Hindrances the GM feels are appropriate and are 
not made like player characters. Just give them the abilities 
you want them to have and spend your time and mental 
energy on better things, like the plot of the game or how best 
to entertain your group. 

129 

Chapter Seven: 
Bestiary 
Monstrous Abilities 
Aquatic

The creature is native to the water. It is a natural swimmer 
and cannot drown. While in the water, its Pace is generally 
equal to its Swimming skill, but some creatures (usually fish) 
may have much higher movement rates. 

Armor 

A creature’s Armor adds to the creature’s Toughness 
(already added in to its statistics), usually in all locations. 
Thick, leathery hide generally offers 2 points of Armor. 
“Armored” creatures like a stegosaurus generally have 4 or 
more points of protection. Supernatural creatures may have 
much higher Armor values. A living statue, for example, might 
have 8 points of Armor or more. 

Burrowing

From massive worms to sand-dwelling humanoids, many 
creatures are able to burrow beneath the earth and move 
within it. These creatures can tunnel underground and 
reappear elsewhere for devastating surprise attacks against 
their foes. The distance a creature can burrow in a turn 
is written immediately after its Burrow ability. A burrowing 
creature may tunnel on its action, and may erupt from the 
ground at any point within its burrowing Pace the same round 
if desired. It cannot be attacked while beneath the earth 
unless the attacker has some special means of detecting it 
and penetrating the intervening dirt. 

Burrowing creatures strike by erupting from beneath their 
opponents and taking them by surprise. When this occurs, 
the Burrowing creature makes an opposed Stealth roll versus 
the target’s Notice. If the creature wins, it gains +2 to attack 

and damage that round, or +4 if it gets a raise. If the victim 
wins and was on Hold, he may try to interrupt the burrower’s 
attack as usual. 

Construct 

Robots, golems, and other animated objects are collectively 
called “constructs.” Some are sentient beings while others 
are mere automatons following the will of a hidden master. 

Whatever their origin or material, such beings have several 
inherent advantages over creatures of flesh and blood: 

• 
Constructs add +2 when attempting to recover from 
being Shaken. 
• 
Constructs do not suffer additional damage from called 
shots (unless otherwise specified in their description). 
• 
Construct Wild Cards never suffer from Wound Modifiers. 
• 
Constructs do not suffer from disease or poison. 
Elemental 

Air, earth, fire, and water form the basis of the elemental 
realms, wherein dwell strange, unfathomable creatures. 

• 
Elementals suffer no additional damage from called shots. 
• 
Elementals are Fearless. 
• 
Elemental Wild Cards never suffer from Wound Modifiers. 
• 
Elementals do not suffer from disease or poison. 
Ethereal 

Ghosts, shadows, will-o’-the-wisps, and similar intangible 
creatures have no form in the physical world (or can turn it on 
and off at will). They cannot be harmed by physical attacks, 
and cannot even be seen unless they desire to be. Ethereal 
creatures are always affected by magical items, weapons, 
and supernatural powers. 

130 

Most ethereal creatures can still affect things in the physical 
world—throwing objects, wielding ghostly swords, or even 
pushing heroes down long, dark stairs. 

Fear 

Particularly frightening monsters cause Fear checks to all 
who see them. Some truly terrifying monsters may inflict 
penalties on Fear checks as well. A creature with Fear –2, for 
instance, causes those who see it to make their Fear checks 
at –2. See the Fear rules on page 85 for effects. 

Fearless 

Mindless creatures, some undead, robots, and the like don’t 
suffer from the weaknesses of the mortal mind. Fearless 
creatures never suffer from Fear effects and cannot be 
Intimidation (though they may be affected by Taunts). 

Flight

The creature can fly at the listed Pace and ignores the effects 
of difficult ground. The flyer also has a Climb score that reflects 
its in-air maneuverability. The number is entirely relative and 
is mostly used for Chases to determine if the beast is more 
maneuverable than its foes (see pages 58 and 82). 

Gargantuan

Gargantuan creatures are those that are at least size 9 or 
better. Classic movie monsters like Godzilla or King Kong fit 
into this category. Gargantuans have Heavy Armor, so they 
can only be hurt by Heavy Weapons, and all their attacks 
count as Heavy Weapons as well. 

Gargantuans suffer the penalty for being Huge: +4 to attack 
rolls from man-sized creatures. 

When a Gargantuan creature makes a stomp attack (Game 
Master’s call), add its Size to its damage roll, but subtract 
the Size of the foe as well. Don’t add the size of inanimate 
obstacles such as vehicles, buildings, or ships—that’s already 
figured into their Toughness. 

Hardy

Very tough and resilient creatures do not fall from lesser 
wounds, no matter how many they suffer. A decisive blow is 
needed to put one of these tenacious creatures down. 

If the beast is Shaken, further Shaken results have no further 
effect—they do not cause a wound. 

Infection 

A vampire’s bite, a horrid spider-like creature that injects 
eggs into its victim’s wounds, or even the disease-born 
scratching of rats are all examples of Infection. 

Whenever a character is Shaken or wounded by a creature 
with Infection, the victim must make a Vigor roll. Modifiers 
to the roll are listed in the creature’s description, as are the 
effects of failure. 

Infravision 

Nocturnal beasts often see in the infrared spectrum— 
meaning they can “see” by detecting heat. Creatures with 
Infravision halve penalties (round down) for bad lighting when 
attacking living targets. 

Clever characters may figure out ways to mask their heat 
from such creatures. Smearing cold mud over one’s body or 
wearing special heat-filtering suits generally obscures the 
target from those with Infravision. Creatures with Infravision 
almost always have normal sight as well. 


131 

Immunity

Creatures born in fire aren’t affected by heat, and a horror 
made of pure lightning won’t suffer from a bolt attack with an 
electrical trapping. 

Immunities are always to specific types of attacks, such 
as fire, cold, electricity, and so on. Such creatures aren’t 
Invulnerable, they just ignore damage from the specific attack 
types named. 

Invulnerability

Savage Settings are filled with violent combat, but many 
often feature desperate puzzle-solving or dark research into 
unholy horrors as well. To defeat an Invulnerable creature, 
you’ll need a little of both. 

Invulnerable creatures can be Shaken, but they can’t be 
wounded by anything but their Weakness (all such creatures 
have at least one if not more). An ancient dark god given 
life by misguided cultists, for example, might be immune to 
mortal weapons, but is vulnerable to shards of stained glass 
gathered from a church. 

Low Light Vision

Many monsters, and even fantasy races such as elves 
and dwarves, are typically able to see in all but the blackest 
darkness. Low light vision ignores penalties for Dim and Dark 
lighting, allowing the creature to see in all but pitch black 
conditions. 

Paralysis

Certain creatures and poisons can instantly paralyze a foe, 
rendering the victim easy prey for the thing’s dark designs or 
ravenous appetite. A target who suffers damage or a Shaken 
result from such a creature must make a Vigor roll or be 

paralyzed and incapable of any action—even speech—for 
2d6 rounds or longer. 

Poison 

Snakes, venom-coated daggers, and so on afflict their 
victims with dangerous poison. Poisons are described in more 
detail in the Hazards section. 

A creature with the Poison ability typically injects it via a bite 
or scratch. To do so, the thing must cause at least a Shaken 
result to the victim, who then makes a Vigor roll modified by 
the strength of the poison (listed in parentheses after the 
creature’s Poison ability). The effects of failure are described 
in each creature’s description. 

Regeneration

Legend has it that trolls, vampires, and certain other types of 
legendary creatures can Regenerate damage caused to them. 

Regeneration comes in two types: Fast and Slow. 

• 
Fast Regeneration lets a wounded creature make a Vigor 
roll every round to heal any damage it has sustained— 
even after it has been “killed.” A success heals one wound 
(or removes Incapacitated status), and a raise heals an 
additional wound. Most creatures with this ability also 
have a Weakness or Vulnerability, such as fire. Wounds 
from the creature’s Weakness or Vulnerability do not 
regenerate, but may still heal naturally. Creatures with 
Fast Regeneration also add +2 to Spirit rolls made to 
recover from being Shaken. 
• 
Slow Regeneration means the creature won’t be 
suddenly healing itself during a fight, but may recover its 
wounds quickly between encounters. Slow regenerators 
make a natural Healing roll once per day. 
132 

Size 

A creature’s size has a lot to do with how much damage it 
can take, so we add a modifier to its Toughness to reflect its 
tremendous mass. Note that a beast’s size has nothing to do 
with Vigor—even a mighty kraken can catch a cold or tire out. 

The Toughness modifiers on the table below represent 
average specimens of particular species for comparison, 
but there are always exceptions. Not every great white has 
a +4 Toughness bonus. A young specimen might have a +3, 
while a larger fish might be +5 or even +6. The same is true 
for humans. Small humans suffer a –1 penalty, while those 
with the Brawny Edge gain a +1 bonus. Use the table as a 
baseline when creating your own creatures then adjust for 
particularly large or smaller versions. 

Toughness Modifiers 
Mod Size of a... 

–2 Cat, fairy, pixie, large rat, dog 

–1 Large dog, bobcat, half-folk, goblin, small human 

0 Human 

+1 Orc 

+2 Bull, gorilla, bear, horse 

+3 Ogre, kodiak bear 

+4 Rhino, great white shark 

+5 Small elephant 

+6 Drake, bull elephant 

+7 T-Rex, orca 

+8 Dragon 

+9 Blue whale 

+10 Kraken, leviathan 

. Minimum Toughness: Normal creatures have a minimum 
Toughness of 2 regardless of modifiers. Only insects and the 
like have Toughness scores of 1. 
Small/Large/Huge

Creatures the size of rats or pixies are very difficult to hit, 
especially when moving. Assuming such a creature is active, 
attackers subtract 2 from any attack rolls directed at it. 

Large creatures, at least the size of a rhino, are somewhat 
easier to hit. Attackers may add +2 to any attack rolls directed 
at Large targets. 

Truly Huge creatures, at least as big as a dragon, are +4 
to be hit. 

This particular special ability is relative. Two elephants don’t 
get the bonus when fighting each other, but a pixie who joins 
the fight adds +4 to its roll. If the elephant strikes back, it 
subtracts 4 from its roll. 

Strength

Strength is a Trait, not a special ability, but because very 
large creatures exceed the normal human range of d4 to d12, 
you might need a little more information when creating your 
own creatures. 

Creatures of human or lesser Strength should be expressed 
as a d4 through a d12, as you think appropriate. Stronger 
creatures, such as gorillas, ogres, and so on, have a d12 plus 
a bonus. The bonus depends on how strong the creature is 

and how well it can use that strength in combat. Just as with 
humans, there is variation within each species, however. A 
mother gorilla may have a Strength of d12+1, while her much 
larger mate has a Strength of d12+3. 

Here’s a quick comparison to help you figure out what 
Strength creatures of your own creation should have. 

Creature Strength 
Creature 
Strength 

Gorilla, bear, ogre d12+1 to +3 
Rhino, great white d12+3 to +6 
Elephant, drake, T-Rex d12+5 to +8 
Dragon d12+9 to +12 

Stun 

A creature with this ability often has an electrical attack, mild 
toxin, mind lash, or similar trapping. When it successfully hits 
a character (even if it causes no damage), the victim must 
make a Vigor roll minus any listed penalties or be Shaken. He 
cannot attempt to recover from being Shaken for 1d6 rounds. 

Undead 

Zombies, skeletons, and similar Undead horrors are 
particularly difficult to destroy. Below are the benefits of being 
such an abomination. 

• Undead add +2 to their basic Toughness. 
• 
Undead add +2 when attempting to recover from being 
Shaken. 
• Undead don’t suffer additional damage from called shots. 
• 
Undead Wild Cards never suffer from Wound Modifiers. 
• Undead do not suffer from disease or poison. 
Wall Walker 

Some creatures have the ability to walk on walls. These 
creatures only make Climbing rolls in the most adverse and 
stressful situations—otherwise they automatically walk on 
vertical or inverted surfaces just as a human walks on the 
earth. 

A Wall Walker’s Pace when walking on walls is its standard 
movement rate. It may run as usual when walking on walls 
unless the specific creature’s text says otherwise. 

Weakness 

Some creatures suffer additional damage or other effects 
when attacked by their Weakness. A creature made of ice, 
for example, might take double damage from fire. A vampire 
suffers from a Weakness to sunlight, causing it to catch fire 
and burn when exposed to its rays. 

See the creature’s description for the particular effects of 
its Weakness. 

Some creatures can only be killed by their Weakness. They 
may feel pain or even become Shaken from other attack 
types, but only suffer wounds when struck by their Weakness. 
A vampire, for instance, ignores wounds from swords and 
bullets, but suffers damage normally if hit in the heart with a 
wooden stake.

Bestiary 
Below is a sampling of some common animals and monsters 
common to many Savage Settings. Note that for some 
creatures, Smarts is listed relative to the animal world, and 
is thus followed by an (A) to remind you that this is animal 
intelligence, not people intelligence, so don’t expect a dolphin 
to drive off in your tank just because it’s a relatively smart 
animal. Creatures with animal intelligence do not typically 
Advance as Allies—this only happens if the animal is gained 
via an Edge. 

Alligator/Crocodile

Alligators and crocs are staples of most 
pulp-genre adventure games. The statistics 
here represent an average specimen of 
either species. Much larger versions are 
often found in more remote areas. 

Attributes: Agility d4, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d6, 
Strength d10, Vigor d10 
Skills: Fighting d8, Notice d6, Swimming d8 
Pace: 3; Parry: 6; Toughness: 9 (2) 

Special Abilities 

• 
Armor +2: Thick skin. 
• Aquatic: Pace 5. 
• Bite: Str+d6. 
• 
Rollover: Both gators and crocs are notorious for 
grasping their prey in their vice-like jaws and rolling over 
and over with their flailing victims in their mouth. If one 
of these large amphibians hits with a raise, it causes an 
extra 2d4 rollover damage to its prey in addition to its 
regular Strength damage. 
Bear, Large

Large bears covers grizzlies, kodiaks, and 
massive polar bears. 
Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d6 (A), Spirit 
d8, Strength d12+4, Vigor d12 
Skills: Fighting d8, Notice d8, Swimming d6 
Pace: 8; Parry: 6; Toughness: 10 
Special Abilities 

• 
Bear Hug: Bears don’t actually “hug” their victims, but 
they do attempt to use their weight to pin their prey and 
rend it with their claws and teeth. A bear that hits with a 
raise has pinned his foe. The opponent may only attempt 
to escape the “hug” on his action, which requires a raise 
on an opposed Strength roll. 
• 
Claws: Str+d6. 

• 
Size +2: These creatures can stand up to 8’ tall and weigh 
over 1000 pounds. 
Bull 

Bulls are usually only aggressive toward 
humans when enraged. Of course, if you’re 
looking up the statistics here, it’s probably 
already seeing red. 

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit 
d8, Strength d12+2, Vigor d12 
Skills: Fighting d4, Notice d6 

Pace: 7; Parry: 4; Toughness: 10

with their long horns. If they can move at least 6” before 
attacking, they add +4 to their damage total. 
• 
Size +2: Bulls are large creatures. 
Cat, Small 

This is an ordinary house cat, the sort that 
might be a familiar for a spellcaster, a Beast 
Master’s animal friend, or an alternate form 
for the shape change power. 

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d6 (A), Spirit 
d10, Strength d4, Vigor d6 
Skills: Climbing d6, Notice d6, Stealth d8 
Pace: 6; Parry: 3; Toughness: 3

Strength d8, Vigor d8 
Skills: Fighting d8, Intimidation d8, Notice d6 
Pace: 10; Parry: 6; Toughness: 6

opponent’s soft spots. With a raise on its attack roll, it 
hits the target’s most weakly armored location. 
• 
Fleet-Footed: Dire wolves roll d10s instead of d6s when 
running. 
Dog/Wolf

The stats below are for large attack 
dogs, such as Rottweilers and Doberman 
Pinschers, as well as wolves, hyenas, and 
the like. 

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d6 (A), Spirit d6, 
Strength d6, Vigor d6 
Skills: Fighting d6, Notice d10 
Pace: 8; Parry: 5; Toughness: 4

..Drake 

Drakes are non-flying dragons with animal 
intelligence (rather than the more human-like 
sentience of true dragons). They are much 
more aggressive in direct combat than their 
distant cousins, however. 

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d6 (A), Spirit d10, 
Strength d12+6, Vigor d12 
Skills: Fighting d10, Intimidation d12, Notice d8

2d10 damage and must check to see if they catch fire 
(see Fire). A drake may not attack with its claws or bite 
in the round it breathes fire. 
• 
Large: Attackers add +2 to their attack rolls when 
attacking a drake due to its large size. 
• 
Size +5: Drakes are over 20’ long from snout to tail, and 
weigh in at over 3000 pounds. 
• 
Tail Lash: A drake can sweep all opponents in its rear 
facing in a 3” long by 6” wide rectangle. This is a standard 
Fighting attack, and damage is equal to the creature’s 
Strength –2. 
..Dragon

Dragons are fire-breathing 
monsters that bring doom and 
despair to the villages they 
ravage. Such creatures 
should not be fought lightly 
as they are more than a 
match for even a party of 
experienced adventurers. 
These beasts are quite 
intelligent as well, and use 
all of their advantages when 
confronted by would-be dragon-
slayers. 

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d8, Spirit d10, Strength d12+9, 
Vigor d12 
Skills: Fighting d10, Intimidation d12, Notice d12

dragon may not attack with its claws or bite in the round 
it breathes fire. 
• 
Flight: Dragons have a Flying Pace of 24” and Climb 0. 
• 
Hardy: The creature does not suffer a wound from being 
Shaken twice. 
• 
Huge: Attackers add +4 to their Fighting or Shooting rolls

Breath ability, it may make two Fighting attacks with no 
penalty.

is over 40’ long from nose to tail, and weighs well over 
30,000 pounds.

facing in a 3” long by 6” wide square. This is a standard 
Fighting attack, and damage is equal to the dragon’s 
Strength –2. 
Elementals 

Elementals are living spirits of earth, fire, water, and air. 
These are average examples of such creatures. They may 
be more or less powerful in specific settings. 

Earth Elemental 

Earth elementals manifest as five-foot tall, 
vaguely man-shaped collections of earth and 
stone. Though amazingly strong, they are 
also quite slow and ponderous.

• 
Fiery Touch: Str+d6; chance of catching fire. 
• 
Flame Strike: Fire elementals can project a searing blast 
of flame using the Cone Template. Characters within the 
cone must beat the spirit’s Shooting roll with Agility or 
suffer 2d10 damage, plus the chance of catching fire. 
136 

Water Elemental 

Water spirits are frothing, man-shaped 

creatures of water and sea-foam.

them 1d6 damage but is instantly put out if it hits. 
• 
Seep: Water elementals can squeeze through any porous 
gap as if it were Difficult Ground. 
• 
Slam: Str+d6, nonlethal damage. 
• 
Waterspout: Water spirits can project a torrent of water 
using the Cone Template. Those in the area may make 
an Agility roll opposed by the spirit’s Shooting to avoid 
it or suffer 2d8 nonlethal damage. This puts out any 
normal fires. 
Air Elemental 

Air elementals manifest as sentient 

whirlwinds. 
Attributes: Agility d12, Smarts d6, Spirit d6, 
Strength d8, Vigor d6 
Skills: Fighting d8, Notice d8, Shooting d6

Flight: Air Elementals fly at a rate of 6” with a Climb of 
3. They may not run. 
• 
Invulnerability: Immune to all non-magical attacks 
except fire. 
• 
Push: The air elemental can use an action to push 
a single adjacent target 1d6” directly away with a 
concentrated blast of air. The victim makes a Strength 
roll, with each success and raise reducing the amount 
moved by 1” (to a minimum of 0). 
• 
Wind Blast: Air Elementals can send directed blasts of 
air at foes using the Cone Template and a Shooting roll. 
Foes may make an opposed Agility roll to avoid the blast. 
The damage is 2d6 points of nonlethal damage. 
• 
Whirlwind: As long as the air elemental does not move 
that turn it may attempt to pick up a foe. Make an opposed 
Strength check and if the air elemental wins then its foe 
is pulled into the swirling maelstrom of its body. While 
trapped, the target is at –2 on all rolls including damage, 
to hit and Strength rolls to free himself. The air elemental 
cannot move as long as it wants to keep foes trapped 
inside its form. 
..Giant Worm 
Massive worms tunneling 
beneath the earth to gobble up 
unsuspecting adventurers are 
sometimes found in lonesome 
flatlands. The things sense 
vibrations through the earth, 
hearing a walking person at 
about 200 yards. The stats 
below are for a monster some 
50’ long. 

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d6 
(A), Spirit d10, Strength d12+10, Vigor

Shaken twice. 
• 
Size +10: Giant worms are usually well over 50’ long and

return from death to haunt the living or fulfill 
some lost goal.

by magical attacks. 
• 
Fear –2: Ghosts cause Fear checks at –2 when they let 
themselves be seen. 
Goblin 

Goblins of myth and legend are far more 
sinister creatures than some games and 
fiction portray. In the original tales, they were 
terrifying creatures that stole into homes in 
the middle of the night to steal and eat unruly 
children. The statistics here work for both 
dark “fairy tale” goblins as well as those found 
alongside orcs in contemporary roleplaying games.

any round its rider doesn’t make a trick 
maneuver of some kind.

Perhaps the most diabolical creature in any 
fantasy land is the lich—a necromancer 
so consumed with the black arts that he 
eventually becomes undead himself. 

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d12+2, Spirit 
d10, Strength d10, Vigor d10 
Skills: Fighting d8, Intimidation d12, Knowledge (Occult)

every spell available. 
• 
Undead: +2 Toughness; +2 to recover from being 
Shaken; called shots do no extra damage; ignores wound

Zombie: Liches are necromancers first and foremost. 
The undead they raise through the zombie spell are 
permanent, so they are usually surrounded by 4d10 
skeletons or zombies as they choose. Some liches have 
entire armies of the undead at their disposal. 
Lion 

The kings of the jungle are fierce predators, 
particularly in open grassland where their 
prey cannot seek refuge.

its next action when performing the maneuver however. 
• 
Size +2: Male lions can weigh over 500 pounds. 
Mech (Sentinel)

The stats below are for a 12’ high 
mechanized sentinel such as might 
be found in a typical hard sci-fi 
campaign. This is a light patrol-
style platform with reasonable 
intelligence, a sensor package, 
and high maneuverability. 

Larger mechs outfitted for 
battle have substantially more 
armor, are larger, and have more 
specialized weaponry. 

Attributes: Agility d4, Smarts d6, Spirit 
d4, Strength d6, Vigor d8 
Skills: Fighting d6, Notice d10, Shooting d8 
Pace: 10; Parry: 5; Toughness: 10 (4)

• 
Construct: +2 to recover from being Shaken; called 
shots do no extra damage; does not suffer from disease 
or poison. 
• 
Fearless: Mechs are immune to fear and Intimidation, but 
may be smart enough to react to fear-causing situations 
appropriately. 
• 
Sensors: Sentinel mechs are equipped with sensor 
packages that halve penalties for darkness, can detect 
sounds, or record conversations via directional microphones. 
138 

Minotaur 

Minotaurs stand over 7’ tall and have 
massive, bull-like heads and horns. In 
many fantasy worlds, they are used as 
guardians of labyrinths. In others, they are 
simply another race of creatures occupying a 
fantastically savage setting. In all cases, they 
are fierce beasts eager for battle and the taste of 
their opponents’ flesh. 

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d6, Spirit d8, Strength d12+2, 
Vigor d12 
Skills: Fighting d10, Intimidation d12, Notice d10, Throwing d6

6” before attacking, they add +4 to their damage total. 
• 
Size +2: Minotaurs stand over 7’ tall. 
Mule 

Mules are a cross between a donkey and a 

horse, and are usually used to haul heavy 

goods or pull wagons. 

Like any good pet, the GM should feel 
free to give the mule a little personality. The 

expression “stubborn as a mule” certainly 
comes to mind. 
Attributes: Agility d4, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d6, Strength d8, 


Vigor d8 
Skills: Notice d4 
Pace: 6; Parry: 2; Toughness: 8

Ogre

Ogres are kin to orcs and lesser giants. They

strength. Orcs often pit their “pet” ogres in 
savage combats against their rivals’ ogres. 

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d4, Spirit d6, 
Strength d12+3, Vigor d12

Infravision: Halves penalties for poor light vs. warm 
targets.

The leader of small orc clans is always the 
most deadly brute in the bunch. Orc chieftains 
generally have a magical item or two in settings 
where such things are relatively common (most 
“swords and sorcery” worlds). 

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d6, Spirit d6, 
Strength d10, Vigor d10 
Skills: Fighting d12, Intimidation d10, Notice d6, Shooting

attacking a great white due to its large size. 
• 
Size +4: Great whites can grow up to 25’ in length. 
Shark, Medium Maneater 

These statistics cover most medium-sized 

mankillers, such as tiger sharks and bulls. 
Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit 
d6, Strength d8, Vigor d6 
Skills: Fighting d8, Notice d12, Swimming

Pace: —; Parry: 6; Toughness: 5 

Special Abilities 

• Aquatic: Pace 10. 
• Bite: Str+d6. 
Skeleton 

The skin has already rotted from these risen 
dead, leaving them slightly quicker than their 
flesh-laden zombie counterparts. They are 
often found swarming in vile necromancers’ 
legions. 

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d4, Spirit d4, 
Strength d6, Vigor d6 
Skills: Fighting d6, Intimidation d6, Notice d4, Shooting d6 
Pace: 7; Parry: 5; Toughness: 7 
Gear: Varies. 

Special Abilities 

• 
Bony Claws: Str+d4. 
• 
Fearless: Skeletons are immune to Fear and Intimidation. 
• 
Undead: +2 Toughness; +2 to recover from being 
Shaken; called shots do no extra damage. 
Snake, Constrictor 

Pythons, boa constrictors, and other snakes 
over 15’ long are rarely deadly to man in the 
real world because they aren’t particularly 
aggressive toward such large prey. In 
games, however, such snakes might be 
provoked, drugged, or just plain mean. 

Attributes: Agility d4, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d8, Strength d6, 
Vigor d6 
Skills: Fighting d6, Notice d10 
Pace: 4; Parry: 5; Toughness: 5 

Special Abilities 

• 
Bite: Str. 
• 
Constrict: Large constrictors have very little chance 
of entangling active man-sized prey in the real world— 
they must attack while their victim is sleeping, stunned, 
paralyzed, and so on. Constrictors in pulp and other 
fantastic genres might be far more deadly. These 
creatures bite when they succeed at a Fighting roll, and 
entangle when they succeed with a raise. The round they 
entangle and each round thereafter, they cause damage 
to their prey equal to Str+d6. The prey may attempt to 
escape on his action by getting a raise on an opposed 
Strength roll. 
Snake, Venomous 

Here are the stats for Taipans (Australian 
brown snakes), cobras, and similar medium-
sized snakes with extremely deadly poison. 

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit 
d6, Strength d4, Vigor d4 
Skills: Fighting d8, Notice d12 
Pace: 4; Parry: 6; Toughness: 2 

Special Abilities 

• 
Bite: Str. 
• 
Poison: See the Poison rules on page 89. 
• 
Quick: Snakes are notoriously fast. They may discard 
Action Cards of 5 or lower and draw another. They must 
keep the replacement card, however. 
• 
Size –2: Most venomous snakes are 4-6’ in length, but 
only a few inches thick. 
• 
Small: Anyone attacking a snake must subtract 2 from 
his attack rolls. 
Spider, Giant

Giant spiders are about the size of large dogs 
and live in nests of 1d6+2 arachnids. They 
frequently go hunting in these packs when 
prey is scarce in their home lair. 

Their dens are littered with the bones and 
treasures of their victims, often providing ripe 
pickings for those brave enough to venture within. 

Attributes: Agility d10, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d6, Strength 
d10, Vigor d6 
Skills: Climbing d12+2, Fighting d8, Intimidation d10, Notice 
d8, Shooting d10, Stealth d10 
Pace: 8; Parry: 6; Toughness: 5 

Special Abilities 

• 
Bite: Str+d4. 

• 
Poison (–4): See the poison rules on page 89. 
• 
Wall Walker: Can walk on vertical surfaces at Pace 8. 
• 
Webbing: The spiders can cast webs from their thorax 
that are the size of Small Burst Templates. This is a 
Shooting roll with a range of 3/6/12. Anything in the web 
must cut or break their way free (Toughness 7). Webbed 
characters can still fight, but all physical actions are at –4. 
140 

Swarm 

Sometimes the most deadly foes come 
in the smallest packages. The swarm 
described below can be of most anything— 
from biting ants to stinging wasps to filthy 
rats. 

The swarm is treated just like a creature. When it is 
wounded, the swarm is effectively dispersed. 

Swarms cover an area equal to a Medium Burst Template 

and attack everyone within every round. 
Attributes: Agility d10, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d12, Strength 
d8, Vigor d10 

Skills: Notice d6 
Pace: 10; Parry: 4; Toughness: 7 

Special Abilities 

• 
Bite or Sting: Swarms inflict hundreds of tiny bites 
every round to their victims, hitting automatically and 
causing 2d4 damage to everyone in the template. 
Damage is applied to the least armored location (victims 
in completely sealed suits are immune). 
• 
Split: Some swarms are clever enough to split into two 
smaller swarms (Small Burst Templates) should their 
foes split up. The Toughness of these smaller swarms is 
lowered by –2 (to 5 each). 
• 
Swarm: Parry +2; Because the swarm is composed of 
scores, hundreds, or thousands of creatures, cutting 
and piercing weapons do no real damage. Area-effect 
weapons work normally, and a character can stomp to 
inflict his damage in Strength each round. Swarms are 
usually foiled by jumping in water (unless they are aquatic 
pests, such as piranha). 
Troll 

Trolls in myths and legends are horrid, 
flesh-eating creatures who live in deep 
woods, beneath bridges, or in hidden 
mountain caves. In modern games and 
fiction, trolls are monsters with the ability to 
regenerate damage and a weakness to fire. 
These statistics reflect both backgrounds. 

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d4, Spirit d6, Strength d12+2, 
Vigor d10 
Skills: Fighting d8, Intimidation d10, Notice d6, Swimming 
d6, Throwing d6 
Pace: 7; Parry: 6; Toughness: 10 (1) 
Gear: Spiked club (Str+d8). 


Special Abilities 

• Armor +1: Rubbery hide. 
• Claws: Str+d4. 
• 
Improved Sweep: May attack all adjacent foes at no 
penalty. 
• 
Fast Regeneration: Trolls may attempt a natural healing 
roll every round unless their wounds were caused by 
fire or flame. This occurs whether the troll is a Wild Card 
leader or an Extra. If the latter, a downed troll actually 
returns to action if it heals itself (and is not Shaken—even 
if it was before being Incapacitated). 
• 
Size +2: Trolls are tall, lanky creatures over 8’ tall. 
..Vampire, AncientBlood-drinkers of lore are common in many 

fantasy games. The statistics below are for 

a vampire somewhat below the legendary 

Dracula, but far above those bloodsuckers 

fresh from the grave (detailed next). The abilities 

listed below are standard—the GM may want to 

add other Edges as befits the vampire’s previous lifestyle. 

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d10, Spirit d10, Strength d12+3, 
Vigor d12 
Skills: Fighting d10, Intimidation d12, Notice d8, Shooting 
d8, Swimming d8, Throwing d8 
Pace: 6; Parry: 7; Toughness: 10 

Special Abilities 

• 
Change Form: As an action, a vampire can change into 
a wolf or bat with a Smarts roll at –2. Changing back into 
humanoid form requires a Smarts roll. 
• 
Charm: Vampires can use the puppet power on the 
opposite sex using their Smarts as their arcane skill. 
They can cast and maintain the power indefinitely, but 
may only affect one target at a time. 
• 
Children of the Night: Ancient vampires have the ability 
to summon and control wolves or rats. This requires an 
action and a Smarts roll at –2. If successful, 1d6 wolves 
or 1d6 swarms of rats (see Swarm) come from the 
surrounding wilds in 1d6+2 rounds. 
• 
Claws: Str +d4. 
• 
Improved Frenzy: Vampires may make two attacks per 
round without penalty.

Weaknesses. They may be Shaken by other attacks, but 
never wounded. 
• 
Level Headed: Vampires act on the best of two cards.

Mist: Greater vampires have the ability to turn into mist. 
This requires an action and a Smarts roll at –2. 
• 
Sire: Anyone slain by a vampire has a 50% chance of 
rising as a vampire themselves in 1d4 days. 
• 
Undead: +2 Toughness; +2 to recover from being 
Shaken; called shots do no extra damage (except to the 
heart—see below). No wound penalties. 
• 
Weakness (Sunlight): Vampires catch fire if any part 
of their skin is exposed to direct sunlight. After that they 
suffer 2d10 damage per round until they are dust. Armor 
does not protect. 
• 
Weakness (Holy Symbol): A character may keep a 
vampire at bay by displaying a holy symbol. A vampire 
who wants to directly attack the victim must beat her in 
an opposed test of Spirit. 
• 
Weakness (Holy Water): A vampire sprinkled with holy 
water is Fatigued. If immersed, he combusts as if it were 
direct sunlight (see above). 
• 
Weakness (Invitation Only): Vampires cannot enter a 
private dwelling without being invited. They may enter 
public domains as they please. 
• 
Weakness (Stake Through the Heart): A vampire hit 
with a called shot to the heart (–4) must make a Vigor roll 
versus the damage total. If successful, it takes damage 
normally. If it fails, it disintegrates to dust.

One Sheet Adventures 
On the following pages are a number of “One Sheet” 
adventures. You’ll find dozens more on our website at www. 
peginc.com. 

Why “One Sheet?” Our goal is to give a Game Master 
something he can read, understand, and be ready to run in just 
a few minutes—hence one page (front and back) adventures. 

Players can make characters appropriate for the genre (or 
use the Archetypes on page 18–19) and be ready to play in 
minutes as well. 

One Sheets also demonstrate what we mean by “Fast! 
Furious! Fun!” We get right to the most important aspects 
of the adventure—the setup, what is expected to happen, 
and the statistics for any monsters or villains the heroes are 
likely to fight. 

You won’t find details on the surroundings or statistics for 
nonplayer characters who aren’t directly important to the plot. 
Those are left for you, the Game Master, to make up as you 
go and as they become important to your session. 

If you’re not comfortable filling in the blanks, look for full-
length adventures on our website. Those are generally 
designed for multiple sessions and give far more detail on 
the world and the nonplayer characters.

Knight Errant: Return Engagement 
Something has awakened at the Orpheum, an old building 
that has been everything from a theatre to a slaughterhouse. 
The heroes are employees of Knight Errant, a detective 
agency that specializes in the macabre—and has a very high 
turnover rate… 

. 
Setting Rules: Critical Failures, Gritty Damage 
. 
Characters: The heroes are investigators working with 
the Knight Errant Detective Agency. 
The investigators have been sent to look into the renovation 
of the Orpheum Theatre in a decaying area of a nearby city’s 
downtown. The work has suffered a number of unexplained 
setbacks and the company insuring the project has come 
to suspect that the owner of the theater, Silas Linden, is 
deliberately sabotaging the effort in an attempt at insurance 
fraud. The insurance company has hired Knight Errant to look 
into these grave matters. 

In reality, the construction crew has disturbed a vampire that 
has lain in a comatose state for over half a century. It was 
unwittingly brought to the theater as a display in a freak show 
and abandoned in the basement when the theater closed. 

The monster was once a poor Chinese railroad worker 
who fell victim to another such fiend long ago. It speaks no 
English, and in fact is far too mentally disturbed at this point 
to speak at all. It stirred briefly when the building was used 
as a slaughterhouse, feeding on the blood of the animals that 
drained down to it only to once again lapse into torpor when 
that business closed as well. The thing was awakened recently 
by a tragic accident involving one of the workers. 

Visiting the Orpheum 

The Orpheum is an old building in a rundown section of the 
city. Most of the buildings nearby are abandoned and in poor 
repair. The theater, thanks to its renovations, stands out like 
a diamond in a coal pile. Inside, ornate filigree, marble tiling, 
and generous use of opulent red curtains ooze a sense of 
nostalgia for an earlier, more stylish time. 

Meeting Linden

The investigators find Linden, a short, somewhat heavy-set 
man, very receptive to their arrival. Linden seems genuinely 
concerned about the delays his project has suffered. A number 
of workmen have been injured since the job started and 
rumors are beginning to circulate amongst the men that the 
building is either haunted or cursed. A few have apparently 
been so spooked they simply walked off the job and never 
returned. 

He answers any of their questions to the best of his ability. 
Linden also provides them with unfettered access to the 
theater while the work progresses, warning them that it is 
a construction site and the project has been plagued by no 
shortage of accidents. 

A Little History

If asked, Linden tells the heroes the Orpheum began as 
a theater back at the turn of the 20th century, but closed its 
doors in the early 1920s. The building was converted to a 

slaughterhouse during the Depression, however that business 
folded around the time of the second World War. Much of the 
renovation has involved removing and repairing modifications 
made during the building’s time as a slaughterhouse. 

It has sat unused and unoccupied since then—except, he 
adds, for the usual transients and drug addicts. Linden admits 
he never actually saw any in the theater, but the neighborhood 
was overrun with shady characters. Now, most seem to have 
moved to less active areas in the city. 

Legwork 

Depending on how they approach the investigation, the 
characters can discover a number of clues. Reveal the 
information as the team investigates the theater and the 
neighborhood. Let them ask questions and think about how to 
get these clues—don’t just give them info based on skill rolls. 

• 
Accidents: The first accident occurred while the crew 
was removing the old slaughterhouse equipment. One 
of the men nearly severed an arm on a rusty saw and 
bled out before the ambulance arrived. 
• 
Basement: The lower level is a cluttered mess of boxes, 
crates, and furniture forming a virtual maze. A prop 
elevator sits at the stage end and a large area has been 
cleared around a floor drain under the old orchestra pit. 
There are deep red stains around the drain—left over 
from the slaughterhouse blood sluices. A Notice roll spots 
recent scrapes around the drain cover, indicating it may 
have been moved. 
• 
Financial Ledger: Any investigator scouring Linden’s 
financial records can make an Investigation or Knowledge 
(Accounting) roll. Success finds that the man is so far in 
debt on the project that even if he defaults and collects 
the insurance, he will have to declare bankruptcy. 
• 
Missing Workers: None of the crew has heard from any 
of the other workers who left the site. In fact, in many 
cases, no one ever saw them leave.A Streetwise roll finds 
that most of the missing crewmen had been assigned to 
work clearing the basement level. 
• 
Neighborhood: A Streetwise roll discovers that most 
of the former homeless inhabitants of the area left not 
because of the work at the Orpheum. The few who remain 
tell the investigators that “something woke up” in the 
Orpheum and it preys on anyone foolish enough to be 
caught alone at night. 
• 
Newspaper Reports: An Investigation roll on recent 
newspaper articles finds that shortly after the first 
accident at the Orpheum, a homeless man was found 
dead not far from the theater. The cause of death was 
massive blood loss. 
• 
Orpheum Records: The records from the first Orpheum 
are intact, buried in the basement. The original theater 
turned to displays of the unusual or macabre toward 
the end of its run in an attempt to keep its doors open. 
An Investigation roll uncovers the last display was 
purchased from “Nightlinger’s Traveling Expedition of the 
Extraordinary” and included, among other things, “one 
coffin and contents.” 
144 

The Final Act 


The vampire has created a few offspring from workers and 
homeless victims during its recent feedings. The creatures 
hide in the sewers under the theater, crawling up through the 
drain mainly at night. Rarely, they may snatch a lone worker 
from the basement during the day. 

If the investigators enter the sewers, the undead immediately 
attack. Should they set up watch on the theater during the 
night hours to catch vandals or saboteurs, whether inside or 

out, allow them Notice rolls to spot the monsters creeping 
out to seek prey. 

The young vampires, driven by bloodlust, are feral and fight 
to the death. The ancient vampire tries to flee if it suffers two 
Wounds, attempting to escape into the sewers under the 
theater.

Blood in the Snow 


The following is a tale of vikings, ice, and death. It can take 
place in a fantasy or historical setting as the Game Master 
chooses. Players should be Viking warriors, scouts, or 
shamans with mystical powers. 

. 
Setting Rules: Born a Hero, Blood & Guts 
. 
Characters: Viking warriors, scouts, shamans, or villagers. 
At least one of the characters should have Tracking. 
The heroes are members of a village called Trundheim 
somewhere in the frigid north. They are raiders and warriors, 
but this is the winter season when they spend the harsh days 
and nights enjoying their ill-gotten gains with their families 
and friends. 

To the south are ice-laden seas. To the east and west are 
rival clans. To the north are tall mountains said to be home 
to fierce trolls and massive packs of hungry wolves. It is the 
trolls that pose the most recent threat to Trundheim. 

Two nights ago trolls descended into the village and took 
one of the village’s most beautiful girls—the Jarl’s daughter, 
Brynhilde. The warriors are tasked with venturing out during 
one of the worst blizzards the elders can remember to 
bring her back—or avenge her death with the heads of the 
mysterious trolls. 

The Ice Trolls 

The adventure starts in the small hours of dawn. Sven 
Sjurson, who was on guard duty the last part of the night, 
wakes the village with a cry. He is covered in blood and suffers 
from a nasty blow to the head. Nearby is the home of Jarl 
Steinar, headman of the village. The log wall of the longhall 
has been pulled down and the jarl lies dead in a pool of frozen 
gore. Sven tells the following tale: 

Something terrible came through the darkness. I 

turned to fight but the thing was so tall it blocked out the 
moon! I was about to strike when it swung a massive 
club at my head. The next thing I know I was lying in 
the snow here and…Jarl Steinar was dead. 

The Jarl is a bloody mess. Long claw marks cover his body, 
and it appears the death blow was delivered to his throat. 
A quick search of the rest of the longhall reveals the Jarl’s 
daughter, Brynhilde, is missing—her bed violently overturned 
and furs strewn about the floor. If anyone thinks to look, the 
Jarl’s few valuables are still present. 

In the nearby snow are massive barefoot tracks—the feet at 
least a foot and a half long. Farther out the tracks vanish—a 
fierce snow is setting in and covering them quickly. 

The clan is without leadership, but if the heroes don’t think 
of it on their own, the town elders strongly encourage them to 
form a rescue party and set out immediately. The rest of the 
warriors will need to stay in town to prevent further raids and 
to protect against opportunistic rival clans to the east and west. 

The tracks are fading fast, but they lead to the mountainous 
north. A Tracking roll points the rescue party in the right 
direction. A raise on the Tracking roll reveals there are three 
distinct sets of tracks. 

What Really Happened

Bjorn Thorkellson is the Jarl of the nearby village of Aldavig. 
He desperately wants the favor of the king, but to do so he 
must expand his control to more than a single settlement. 
Trundheim is small but rich thanks to particularly successful 
raids the last few years. Fighting such successful warriors 
would be difficult and likely destroy much of the village, so 
Thorkellson came up with a more subtle plan. He gathered 
a group of his most veteran warriors and tasked them with 
feigning an attack by a monster on the village, killing Jarl 
Steinar in his sleep, and kidnapping his daughter. His own 
hunting band would then “chance” across the beasts, kill 
them, and return as heroes to Trundheim with the princess. 
Thorkellson would be the new Jarl, and with luck, a legend 
sung about by the skalds for ages to come for killing the 
terrible trolls. 

Thorkellson has an ally in the treacherous Sven the Sjurson, 
who has been promised land in the new fiefdom. Sven and the 
raiders killed the Jarl in his sleep and knocked his daughter 
unconscious (the Jarl’s wife died long ago). Then they quietly 
tore down the walls and bashed Sven over the head before 
stealing off into the howling storm. 

Following the Raiders

The kidnappers have headed due north. ATracking roll at –4 
for the gathering snow leads the rescuers quickly to their trail. 
If the roll is failed, the group must make a Vigor roll to resist 
the cold and try again. If the party decides to stop and recover 
(mandatory if one of the heroes becomes Incapacitated), 
they must build a temporary shelter and bundle up. Every 30 
minutes in the shelter removes one level of Fatigue. 

Pack Tactics 

After about half-a-day’s journey north the group comes to 
the foothills. The blizzard picks up and the scattered trees 
are leafless and bare. As the rescuers pick their way through 
the blasted landscape they hear sudden barking from behind. 
Two black wolves stand out against the snow field. Unless 
the characters specifically state they are not turning to look 
at the predators they are ambushed by the rest of the pack 
hiding behind scrub-covered hills to their front. 

• Wolf Pack (6): See Wolves on page 135. 
After the fight, the vikings can skin the wolves for fur and 
meat. If they do so, this extra layer of warmth and fresh food 
grants them +1 to their Vigor rolls versus Fatigue for the rest 
of the adventure. 

As they go about the bloody task, have the group make 
Notice rolls. Whoever rolls highest finds a scrap of red cloth 
on one of the scraggly trees. It is the rich cloth of a chief’s 
daughter—Brynhilde. 

Icy Cliffs

By now all traces of the trolls’ footprints are lost, but legend 
says the trolls live in the caves higher in the mountains. To get 
to those caves the party must climb a series of sheer cliffs. 

Have the group make three Climbing rolls. The rolls are 
made at –2 if the party had to find shelter after leaving the 
village as the blizzard has grown in intensity. 

146 

• 
Total of 1 or less: The character falls for 2d6 damage 
if failed on the first roll, 3d6 on the second, and 4d6 on 
the third. 
• 
Failure: The character suffers a Fatigue level. 
• 
Success: 
The climber ascends this section of the 
mountain. 
After each of the three ascents the heroes must rest. Pick 
a character at random and draw a card for an Interlude. Give 
the player a few minutes to tell his tale, then move on to the 
next roll, or the next scene if it was the third Interlude. 

The Trolls 

After the grueling ascent, have everyone make Notice rolls. 
The highest roll spots smoke coming from somewhere in the 
mountains. With a Survival roll the rescuers find the cave 
quickly. If failed, the group must make a Vigor roll at –2 before 
stumbling upon the troll’s lair. 

The “trolls” wait with the captive Brynhilde beyond a bend 
in the cave. They have a warm fire and stocks of meat and 
mead. Assuming the rescuers approach quietly, they overhear 
the raiders talking to their victim. 

A heavy voice says: “You were taken by trolls, girl. 
Say otherwise and we’ll kill you. You’ll marry Jarl 

Thorkellson and keep your mouth shut.” 

A girl’s voice answers in angry reply, “My father 
raised no weaklings. I’ll not be bullied into betraying 

my clan.” 

“More’s the pity for you then. Thorkellson will have 
his way with you and slit your throat. Then he’ll take 
your broken body back to Trundheim with the sad tale 
of how we tried to rescue you, but with your last words 

you pledged your love and legacy to Thorkellson.” 

The trolls laugh heartily and then grow quiet, feasting on 
hot broth and mead. It’s the perfect time for the heroes to 
strike. Five raiders are in the cave with their war gear nearby. 
A Notice roll also spots false “troll feet” made from various 
hides lying in a pile near the fire. 

The group should be able to strike with surprise against 
the raiders. Unfortunately, the round after the fight begins, 
Jarl Thorkellson and his personal guard show up to the 
rendezvous and attack from behind.

The Ice Cave 


147 

The Salvage of the USS Kaine 

The USS Kaine drifts in the cold reaches of space. The 
crew of the salvage vessel USS Clark discovers the Kaine 
and ventures out to discover its dark secret. 

. 
Setting Rules: Critical Failure, Gritty Damage 
. 
Characters: The heroes are members of a rescue vessel, 
the USS Clark. One of them must be the captain and have 
Piloting and Knowledge (Astronavigation) at d8 or higher. All 
of the crew members must have Repair at d4 or higher. 
The USS Kaine 

The USS Kaine is a deep-space probe designed by the 
United States Navy to investigate anomalies—including signs 
of alien life. It was reported missing after a dangerous mission 
to investigate Black Hole C1263. The ship was to approach 
within scanning distance of the black hole and take detailed 
readings on some unusual energy signals detected there. 

Unfortunately, the Kaine got too close. It wasn’t sucked 
in—that would have destroyed it—but gravitational distortions 
warped the crew’s mind, reducing them to blood-crazed 
lunatics. 

The USS Clark 

The Clark’s computer picked up the Kaine’s faint distress 
signal eight hours ago and the captain set course immediately. 
The vessel is still located near Black Hole C1263, but not 
dangerously so. The Clark will arrive within 10 minutes—just 
enough time to allow the group to make any preparations 
they want. 

Their vessel is equipped with tools of all sorts, deep space 
suits with 10 minutes of continuous propulsion and four hours 
of oxygen, and any other necessities they might think of. The 
crew does not have weapons, but the captain has a pistol and 
a box of 20 ceramic bullets in his cabin if he wants it (Range 
24/48/96, Damage 2d6-2, Shots 7, will not puncture most 
inorganic materials—such as the ship’s hull!) 

The thick suits add +1 Toughness due to their thick material. 
A hero who suffers a wound or more from a cutting or piercing 
attack must repair the suit before heading out of life support 
or he decompresses and dies in 2d6 rounds. 

The Approach

The USS Kaine is largely intact, though some of the 
extending structures have all warped strangely toward the 
bow (an effect of the black hole). There is no obvious damage 
other than the warped superstructure. Scans of the ship show 
there is still residual power and life support functioning. 

Docking with the Kaine requires a standard Piloting roll. A 
critical failure means the airlock is jammed and the salvagers 
have to go EV (extra-vehicular—meaning they move around 
outside the vessels) to enter from the airlock on the opposite 
side. This uses two minutes of propulsion for each spacesuit. 

Life Support & Gravity

Life support is functioning, but the artificial gravity 
generator was overloaded in the surge. The scavengers 

wear electromagnetic boots that allow them to walk normally 
(including on the walls and ceilings!), but cuts their Pace by 
half and inflicts a –2 penalty to all physical actions. 

Should a character turn off the electromagnets in his boots, 
he drifts in whatever direction he moved last. Initial Pace while 
drifting is equal to whatever it was last round, but a scavenger 
may increase or decrease his Pace by 1 or 2 per round by 
using their suit’s microthrusters. 

Maneuvering at a Pace of 6 or less requires no roll. At Pace 
7 or higher, the hero must make an Agility roll to turn sharp 
corners, get through hatchways, make a melee attack, etc. If 
failed at a Pace of less than 10, the character suffers a Fatigue 
level from Bumps and Bruises. At a Pace of 11 or higher, he 
suffers 1d6 damage for every 5” of Pace (round normally). 

The crew of the Kaine does not suffer any penalties due to 
the absence of gravity. They’re quite mad and have adjusted 
by now, so they move effortlessly through the ship, scampering 
along the walls and ceilings like some sort of insectoids. 

Should the scavengers succeed in repairing the Kaine’s 
artificial gravity, however, the situation is reversed. and the 
deranged crew suffers a –2 to all their physical actions! 

Map of the Kaine

. 
Bridge: The Kaine’s navigational equipment needs 
extensive repairs before she can be piloted. Each Repair 
attempt takes an entire day and is made at –2 (in addition to 
any penalties for zero-g). 
. 
Captain’s Cabin: A once neatly maintained cabin, it is 
now a cluttered mess as a variety of old maritime antiques 
and curios float through the room. 
. 
Crew Quarters: Each cabin is a reflection of the former 
occupant. Some are orderly and clean while others are in 
varying degrees of disarray. Nothing of note is to be found in 
any of the rooms. 
. 
Engineering: The engineering section takes up two levels, 
with a balcony overlooking much of the main deck portion. The 
ship’s drive is functional, but the artificial gravity generator is 
temporarily overloaded. Ten minutes labor and a Repair roll 
(–2) can bring it back online. 
. 
Galley: Lightweight tables and chairs float throughout 
the room, along with the body of another of the Kaine’s crew. 
A Healing or Knowledge (Medicine) roll easily identifies the 
cause of death as multiple stab wounds. If the team searches 
the galley, a Notice roll uncovers a butcher knife (Str+d4). 
. 
Laboratories: The Kaine contained three state-of-the-art 
laboratories. With a successful Notice roll, the team members 
can find one small improvised weapon (see page 73) in each 
lab if they are specifically looking for them. 
. 
Ship’s Stores: A variety of standard equipment is kept 
in these rooms, including spare space suits and repair gear, 
but little is of immediate use. A Notice roll spots a pneumatic 
bolt gun (Range 6/12/24, Damage 2d6, Shots 6) which can 
be fired using Shooting or Repair. 
Something’s Amiss

Regardless of how the salvagers proceed in investigating 
the Kaine, they encounter a corpse in the third compartment 

148 

they enter after boarding the ship. The body floats, limbs 
askew, twirling slowly in the absence of gravity. A mist of blood 
globules seems to almost orbit around it. A successful Healing 
or Knowledge (Medicine) roll determines the cause of death 
to be blood loss from numerous cuts, tears, and even bites. 

Ambush 

Immediately after leaving the room where they discover 
the body, the team is attacked by a band of three of the 
former crew of the Kaine. If possible, the lunatics attack in 
a passageway, coming at the party from both sides as they 
scuttle along the walls and ceilings. They have no weapons 
other than their teeth, hands, and feet. 

Marooned! 

Moments after the ambush begins, four other members of 
the Kaine’s crew rush the airlock to the Clark. Any characters 
at the airlock are attacked. If there is no one there, the madmen 
rush into the airlock and manually release the docking tube. 
The airlock protects the integrity of both vessels’ atmosphere, 
but the decompression of the tube blows the vessels apart. 

Unless one of the team has remained on the Clark, the only 
way the salvagers can get back to their vessel is through an 
extended EVA. This requires a successful Agility or Smarts 
roll to navigate the gap. On a failure, the spacefarer expends 
two minutes of propulsion and requires another attempt. On a 
critical failure, it uses five minutes. Once a hero is out of fuel, 
he drifts into the void unless rescued. 

Last Stand 

The Kaine’s captain, Bill Weir, and the remaining five of 
his crew have laired in the engineering section. One floats 
limply through the main deck pretending to be dead while the 
others hide in the shadows of the balcony. If a team member 
approaches the “dead” man, he suddenly comes to life and 
attacks. The hapless victim must make a Fear check unless 
she specifically states she is expecting a trick. Regardless, 
the salvagers must check for surprise. 

The captain and crew attack the next round, diving from 
above. Treat this as a Wild Attack (see page 76). The lunatics 
fight to the death. 

Two of the crewmen on the balcony are armed with butcher 
knives from the galley (Str+d4). Use the Kaine crewman stats 
for Captain Weir, but treat him as a Wild Card. He is also 
armed with a bolt gun, as above.

The Fires of Ascalon 
The ravaging hordes are coming and a party of elven scouts 
must deny them sustenance. The town of Ascalon lies in the 
way and must be burned to the ground—if the villagers can 
be convinced. 

. 
Setting Rules: None. 
. 
Characters: The heroes are all elves or friends of the elves 
fighting in a terrible war against a savage foe. 
The premise of this Savage Tale is that there is a massive 
war in a typical fantasy world of elves, dwarves, men, and 
orcs. The party is assumed to be made exclusively of elves, 
who in this world are viewed as aloof at best or outsiders at 
worst by human society. 

The adventure can be altered to fit other settings—including 
those without elves and humans. The important circumstance 
is that the player character’s party is made up primarily of a 
race or nationality the villagers of Ascalon won’t trust easily. 

The orcs may be any force of chaos and destruction—the 
only thing that matters is that allowing the village’s precious 
resources to fall into the horde’s hands would cause 
devastation for the locals and hardship for the rest of the 
kingdom. 

The Mission 

The heroes are scouts of the elves tasked with an important 
mission. While the main force harries the orcish horde, the 
adventurers are sent to burn the village of Ascalon. This was 
a decision reached by the allied war council, which includes 
humans, but the elves were closest and so were appointed 
with the destruction of the village. 

Read or paraphrase the following from their commander 
when you’re ready to begin: 

The horde approaches more rapidly than anyone 
had believed. But all armies march on their stomachs. 

I will lead our main force in a bitter defense against 
the orcs at Gallows Woods. Your mission will be to 

race to the human village of Ascalon and...I’m afraid... 
burn it to the ground. 

Ascalon has rich farmlands and abundant crops 

that will feed the orcs and prolong their rampage for 
months. Even the wood from the houses and inns 
must be destroyed lest it be turned into weapons or 
siege equipment. 

The horde has approached too quickly. The villagers 
have not been told of this decision by our allied war 
council and will likely have to be forcibly removed. 
Convince them to leave and do not harm them—but 

Ascalon must burn. You leave immediately. 

The heroes are given torches covered in pitch and two flasks 
of quick-burning oil to get the largest buildings burning as fast 
as possible. Ascalon is an hour’s run away and no horses can 
be spared, so they must get moving immediately. 

The run is long and tiring. Have each scout make a Vigor 
roll or suffer Fatigue before they reach Ascalon. Those with 

the Fleet-Footed Edge add +2. This Fatigue can be recovered 
after 30 minutes of rest—precious time the adventures won’t 
likely have. 

Foraging Party

The road to Ascalon from the elven camp winds through 
green, scrub-covered foothills. Halfway along the trek, have 
the group make Notice rolls. Those who make it hear sounds 
of fighting on the path ahead and can gain surprise on the 
first round if they so choose. 

The scene they see before them is an overturned cart laden 
with fruits, vegetables, and flour. Two horses struggle to free 
themselves from the twisted yokes, and three farmers are 
doing their best to fend off three circling orcs riding mangy 
boars. The orcs are foraging for the main horde and chased 
the cart for several hundred yards before the driver took a 
sharp turn and unfortunately overturned the wagon. 

• 
Orcs (3): The orcs ride boars. Use the statistics at the 
end of this adventure. The raiders have Riding at d6. 
Assuming the orcs are slain or driven off, the humans thank 
their rescuers and say that the supplies were a gift to the 
war council from the town. The leader of this small group is 
Nathan Crenshaw, a strong, soft-spoken man of about 50. If 
the elves tell Crenshaw their plan, he and his boys begin to 
right the wagon (it takes 10 minutes). Then he heads back 
to Ascalon to warn the elders and take part in any debate. If 
the elves don’t mention their task, he heads on to the allied 
war camp none the wiser. 

The Elders 

In Ascalon, adults seem alarmed as they spy the mysterious 
elves brazenly enter their town, while the children gather in 
delight at their strange and wondrous visitors. If the elves 
look for someone of authority, they are pointed to Elder Elias 
Stosham, the leader of this village. 

Convincing Stosham of the elves’ mission is an extremely 
difficult task. To do so, use the Social Conflict system on page 

96. The outsiders roll at –4 unless Crenshaw accompanied 
them back from the ambush. If so, his testimony that the elves 
saved him and his companions reduces the penalty to –2. 
If the heroes tie or lose the conflict, the villagers turn hostile 
and attack unless the elves seem willing to leave. 

If the elves win the debate by 1 or 2 successes, Stosham 
orders the villagers to comply with the elves’ “demands.” The 
villagers slowly gather their loved ones and belongings and 
fade off into the countryside. 

If the heroes succeed by three successes or more, the 
villagers gather their belongings and send the women, 
children, and elderly to destinations further behind the lines. 
The men, however, join the allied army, hoping to defeat the 
orcs before any more villages must be sacrificed.

Fire, Fire, Burning Bright 


Whether they are defeated or reluctantly agree to the plan, 
the villagers disperse, and no matter how convincing the 
elves were, they will not help burn their town. The moment 
the heroes begin to set the fires themselves, a raiding party 
of orcs arrives. 

There are four points that must be lit to effectively raze the 
town: the Rampant Lion Inn, the granary silo, the bridge, and 
the livery. The livery still has 2d6 horses and mules in it, so 
the heroes will need to decide if they want to take the time to 
evacuate them first. A loud yell and successful Intimidation 
roll gets 1d4 animals per round, a raise doubles that. Anyone 
with Animal Companion or Beast Bond adds +2 to the roll. The 
beast friend power can also be used on the “lead” horse in 
the livery. All of the other animals follow the round thereafter. 

Setting fire to these four areas ensures the town and its 
supplies are denied to the rampaging greenskins. A hero can 
set one of the objectives on fire as long as he starts his turn in 
contact with it, has a lit torch and oil flask, isn’t Shaken, and 
makes a successful Smarts roll. A failed Smarts roll means 
a small flame is started but isn’t enough to set the building 
truly ablaze. 

If any of these conditions aren’t met, the arsonist must try 
again next round. 

• 
Orc Chieftain: See the statistics on page 139, and add 
Riding d8. 
• 
Orc Raiders: There are 20 orcs riding giant boars (see 
below), though they roam in groups of five so the Game 
Master should space them out accordingly so as not to 
overwhelm the heroes. Orc raiders have Riding d6 in 
addition to their usual skills. 
War Boar 

These massive boars serve as the orcish horde’s mounts. 
They’re 700 pounds of muscle, tusk, stench, and attitude. 
Only orcs are typically tough enough to breed and ride them. 

Attributes: Agility d4, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d6, Strength d10, 
Vigor d10 
Skills: Fighting d8, Intimidation d8, Notice d8 
Pace: 10; Parry: 6; Toughness: 9 

Special Abilities 

• 
Tusk Slash: Str+d6 
• 
Gore: If a boar can charge at least 6” before attacking, 
it adds +4 to its damage total that round. It cannot slash 
and gore in the same action. 
• 
Fleet-Footed: War boars roll d10s instead of d6s when 
running. 
• 
Size: +2. War boars weigh 700 pounds.

Crime City: The Chase 
Crime City was first introduced in the free One Sheet The 
Moscow Connection, available on our website at www.peginc. 
com. This adventure takes place immediately afterward, so 
we recommend you download and run that adventure first, 
but it’s certainly not necessary. 

Our action begins moments after a small group of Russian 
mafia members stop a terrorist cell from bringing in a 
mysterious cargo. Now they must escape with it! 

. 
Setting Rules: Blood & Guts, Critical Failures, Gritty 
Damage, Joker’s Wild, Skill Specialization 
. 
Characters: The player characters are all criminals 
belonging to—or in the employ of—the Russian Mafia. The 
default characters can be found on the opposite page. 
In Media Res 

At the end of The Moscow Connection, the group stopped 
Mahmoud Abbas and a cell of the Red Hand, and took 
possession of a mysterious cargo loaded in the back of a large 
panel truck. What’s the cargo? That’s up to you, the Game 
Master, but it must be big enough to require moving with the 
panel truck. The cargo might be a nuclear bomb, or a dirty 
bomb, or something far more bizarre—such as debris from the 
1908 Tunguska Blast, or an artifact from Chernobyl (since it 
came in on a ship called the Chernobyl Revenge). Or maybe 
it’s a strange device the gangsters don’t even understand. 

Regardless of the nature of the cargo, the Russians need 
to get it out of the area to one of their own warehouses fast. 
Reinforcements of the Red Hand are already on their way and 
a chase through the streets of New York City are on. 

Choose Your Poison 

Start the action as one of the Russians (Ivan if you’re 
using the pregenerated characters as he speaks Farsi) hear 
reinforcements state they’re “almost there” on one of the dead 
terrorists’ radios. 

Then give the players exactly one minute to discuss which 
vehicles they want to take, and who’s driving or riding in 
each. They have to take the truck since it holds the cargo, 
and Mahmoud Abbas’ motorcycle still idles around the corner. 
Alexy also has a black 2005 Ford Tahoe nearby with armored 
plates in the doors as well. 

• 
Motorcycle (2009 Kawasaki Ninja): Acc/TS 20/40, 
Toughness 8(2), Crew 1. 
• 
SUV (2005 Ford Tahoe): Acc/TS 15/35, Toughness 17(7) 
on sides, or 14(3) to front and back, Crew 1+7, Airbags. 
Note that the Tahoe is slightly slower and tougher than 
normal due to the armor-plated side panels. 
• 
Panel Truck: Acc/TS 5/25, Toughness 14(1), Crew 1. 
The Chase Begins

This entire adventure is a Chase. Tell the group that their 
goal is to get the cargo away from the Red Hand, and there’s 
no telling how many reinforcements are swarming in. Even if 
they defeat the first wave, more may come. If the Russians 
are defeated, the mysterious cargo will fall right back into 
their enemies’ hands. 

This is an Extended Chase of 10 rounds. See page 82 for 
details on running Chases. The heroes’ goal is to escape with 
the panel truck and its cargo intact. If the truck and the heroes 
are still moving after 10 rounds, they lose their pursuers and 
escape. If the truck is stopped, see “Last Stand,” below. 

The enemy is composed of fanatical members of the Red 
Hand, riding in two cars and six motorcycles. 

• 
6 x Motorcycle (variety of older models): Acc/TS 15/35, 
Toughness 8(2), Crew 1 each. 
• 
2 x Mid-Size Cars: Acc/TS 20/40, Toughness 11(3), 
Crew 1+3 each. 
The motorcycles have one driver each. The cars have a 
driver, who does not attack, and three passengers, two of 
which can attack on any given action. 

Remember that when the terrorists have Advantage, no 
more than a third of them can attack a particular target at once 
as the various vehicles weave in and out of traffic. 

Complications

The inevitable Complications represent traffic, construction 
work, or blind alleys. In addition, if a red Ace is drawn and 
used by either of the groups, it means the police have been 
drawn to the pursuit. There’s a single police cruiser after the 
first round the Ace is used. After that, roll a d6 at the beginning 
of each new round. On a 4+, another police cruiser shows up. 

• 
Police Cruiser: Acc/TS 20/45, Toughness 12(3), Crew 
2. Use Soldiers for the policemen (page 81). They’re 
equipped with pump-action shotguns and 9mm pistols. 
Only one policeman per cruiser can attack each round, 
but he only shoots at Medium Range or better for fear of 
wild shots hitting civilians. 
Last Stand 

If the Russians stop for any reason, the remaining members 
of the Red Hand dismount and fight on through the next two 
rounds. At the start of the third, another wave (two more cars 
and six more bikes) show up and attack as well. Deal this new 
wave in as a separate group. The cars might try to ram the 
Tahoe, while those on motorcycles might circle and strafe in 
hopes that their fast movement will keep them from getting 
shot. After three more rounds have passed, a truck with a 
dozen more terrorists arrive. 

If the Russians can’t drive away at this point (which renews 
the Extended Chase), they’d best abandon their cargo and 
duck down an alley. The Red Hand won’t pursue—they came 
in force to escort their package. The group might want to figure 
out how they want to get it back before the terrorists put the 
device—whatever it is—to use.

Background: “The Bull” grew up with Alexy, but spent most of his time in the gym or playing sports. He’s a massive, 
mountain of a man, and he likes to prove it by foregoing firearms and blades—though he’s not unskilled in their use. 


His trademark weapon is a Louisville slugger he loves to kiss just before going to work.

2d6 Initial Reaction 

2 Hostile: The target is openly hostile and does his best 
to stand in the hero’s way. He won’t help without an 
overwhelming reward or payment of some kind. 

3–4 Uncooperative: The target isn’t willing to help unless 
there’s a significant advantage to himself. 

5–9 Neutral: The target has no particular attitude and will 
help for little reward if the task at hand is very easy. If 
the task is difficult, he’ll require substantial payment 
of some kind. 

10–11 Friendly: The target will go out of his way for the hero. 
He’ll likely do easy tasks for free (or very little), and 
is willing to do more dangerous tasks for fair pay or 
other favors. 
12 Helpful: The target is anxious to help the hero, and 
will probably do so for little or no pay depending on 
the nature of the task.

Out of Control 
2d6 Effect 

2 Roll Over: The vehicle performs a Slip and rolls over 1d6 times in that direction. Roll collision damage for the 
vehicle and everyone inside. Any exterior-mounted weapons or accessories are ruined. 
3–4 Spin: Move the vehicle 1d6” in the direction of the maneuver, or 1d6” away from a damaging blow. Roll a d12, 
read it like a clock facing, and point the vehicle in that direction. 
5–9 Skid: Move the vehicle 1d4” left or right (in the direction of a failed maneuver, or away from a damaging attack). 
10–11 Slip: Move the vehicle 1d6” left or right (in the direction of a failed maneuver, or away from a damaging attack). 

12 Flip: The vehicle flips end over end 1d4 times. Move it forward that many increments of its own length. Roll 
collision damage for the vehicle, its passengers, and anything it hits. Slow and heavy vehicles such as tanks 
(GM’s discretion) don’t flip but suffer a Slip or Skid instead. 

Critical Hits 
2d6 Effect 
2 Scratch and Dent: The attack merely scratches the paint. There’s no permanent damage. 
3 Engine: The engine is hit. Oil leaks, pistons misfire, etc. Acceleration is halved (round down). This does not affect 

deceleration, however. 
4 Locomotion: The wheels, tracks, or whatever have been hit. Halve the vehicle’s Top Speed immediately. If the 
vehicle is pulled by animals, the shot hits one of them instead. 
5 Controls: The control system is hit. Until a Repair roll is made, the vehicle can only perform turns to one side (1–3 
left, 4–6 right). This may prohibit certain maneuvers as well. 
6–8 Chassis: The vehicle suffers a hit in the body with no special effects. 

9–10 Crew: A random crew member is hit. The damage from the attack is rerolled. If the character is inside the vehicle, 
subtract the vehicle’s Armor from the damage. Damage caused by an explosion affects all passengers in the 
vehicle. 

11 Weapon: A random weapon on the side of the vehicle that was hit is destroyed and may no longer be used. If 
there is no weapon, this is a Chassis hit instead. 
12 Wrecked: The vehicle is wrecked and automatically goes Out of Control.
