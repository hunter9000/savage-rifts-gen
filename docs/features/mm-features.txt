Arcane Background (Psionics): A Mind Melter begins with a great knowledge and understanding of psionics. He begins with five powers from the list above, 20 ISP, and a d8 Psionics skill. 

Expanded Awareness: Mind Melters can use detect arcana at will, as a free action. 

Major Psionic: Mind Melters have the Major Psionic Edge and can spend 2 ISP to gain a +1 with any Psionic skill roll, or 4 ISP for a +2 (paid before the roll is made). These effects are doubled when on a ley line. Each time they take the Power Points Edge, they gain +10 ISP (instead of 5). 

Master Psionic: A Mind Melter has the Master Psionic Edge, gaining all the Mega Powers associated with his selected powers. 

Mental Resistance: A Mind Melter has powerful defenses against the psionic powers of others. He has +4 to all checks to resist psionic effects, and +4 armor against psionic damage. This does stack with Arcane Resistance. 

A Little Odd: Though hardly as far gone as a Crazy, Mind Melters tend to be a little different due to the nature of their powers. Each Mind Melter begins with the Quirk Hindrance. 

Cybernetics: No remotely sane Mind Melter would allow any cybernetics to ruin their carefully tuned mind or body. Medical necessity might dictate otherwise, but such characters suffer −1 to the Psionics skill for each point of Strain. 

Enemies: Mind Melters are shot on sight by all Coalition troops, then shot again to be certain they’re dead. True Federation folks also tend to hate them. 

Feared: Though it’s possible to hide his true nature, if the general populace discovers the presence of a Mind Melter, they tend to be very nervous— and possibly outright terrified. Mind Melters suffer a −2 Charisma when dealing with those who fear them.
