Cyber-Armor: As Toughness. purely a -2 to hit a deflection power. 

First Into Battle: becomes a d12. 

Inner Light:

Minor Psionic:

following powers: 

boost Trait*, confusion, darksight, deflection*, 
environmental protection, havoc, healing*, 
pummel, quickness, smite*, speak language, 
speed*, succor, warrior’s gift. Powers 
marked with an asterisk (*) are usable 
only on the Cyber-Knight but activate 

as a free action, inflicting no 

19 

penalty (a Cyber-Knight with Master 
Psionic can use mass healing but not as 
a free action). All other aspects of AB 
(Psionics) remain the same. 

..Psi-Sword: As a free action, Cyber-
Knights can summon forth a blade 
of spirit and will. It may have any 
appearance but it does not change the 

effects. The Psi-Sword does Strength 

+ Spirit × 2 damage with AP 6 (and no 
Strength minimum). For example, a 

Cyber-Knight with Strength d8 and 
Spirit d10 does 1d8+2d10 melee damage, 
AP 6, with his Psi-Sword. Alternately, 
the Cyber-Knight may split his Psi-
Sword into two blades, one for each 
hand, doing the same damage, but each 

blade only gaining AP 2. For 2 ISP, the 

Cyber-Knight can make the blade inflict 

Mega Damage for as long as the blade 
is manifested. 
..Revered Protectors: All Cyber-Knights 

enjoy +2 Charisma when dealing with 

those who know and love them as 

guardians of life and freedom. 

CYBER-KNIGHT 
COMPLICATIONS 

Life as a guardian and protector in such a 

hostile world is never easy. 

TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE— 


THE CYBER-KNIGHT 

.• 
Starting out, focus on the 
powers your character can 
use as a free action; these are 
lifesavers and give her a serious 
advantage in combat. 

.• 
Big guns can’t be used at melee 
Range, and melee is where the 
Cyber-Knight shines brightest. 

.• 
The inherent reverence many 
have for Cyber-Knights means 
your character may want to also 
focus on being a good “face” for 
the group, leading investigations 
and social interactions. 

..Code of Honor: A Cyber-Knight must 
adhere to the codes and philosophies 
of the Order, or he loses some or all 
of his powers, depending on the 
degree of transgression. Whether this 
is a function of the special nanotech 
treatment he undergoes or a loss of 
confidence damaging his psyche in 

some way is a matter of some debate 

among scholars. Regardless, the Game 
Master must determine the extent of 
a Cyber-Knight’s transgressions and 
assess a penalty accordingly. 

Minor Transgression: -1 to all 

Psionics rolls until he performs a 
noble or heroic deed to atone. 

Major Transgression: -2 to all 

Psionics rolls, and all abilities under 

Cyberkinetic Combat and Inner Light 

cease to function until he undertakes 
some kind of personal (or perhaps 
spiritually guided) quest to atone. 
His Psi-Sword is also reduced to 
doing only his Str+Spirit in damage, 
and all AP values are reduced by 2. 

Mortal Transgression: The Cyber-
Knight commits an action completely 
opposed to the code. All Cyber-
Knight abilities are lost. The character 

may regain his abilities by fulfilling 

a significant quest (determined 
by the Game Master). Should the 
character commit another Mortal 
Transgression before regaining his 
Cyber-Knight status, his spirit is 
corrupted. The character regains use 

of his abilities but becomes a Fallen 

Cyber-Knight (see Savage Foes of North 
America) under the Game Master’s 
control. 

..Cybernetics: Cybernetics are not 
an option for Cyber-Knights, as 
such devices interfere with their 
nanotechnology.
