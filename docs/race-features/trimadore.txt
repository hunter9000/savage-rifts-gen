Long Arms: The Trimadore have a Reach of 1. 

Mechanical Savant: Trimadore are born with an innate capacity for working with and repairing machines. They begin with the Mr. Fix It Edge, ignoring any requirements. 

Non-Standard Physiology: The unique physiology of a Trimadore makes it difficult for him to find armor he can use.

He also suffers -2 to checks made to operate a vehicle or its weapons not refitted for his race. Any gear gained from an Iconic Framework is assumed to be custom-built for the character. 

Technically Savvy: Trimadore love science and technology, studying all they can about such things from birth. Trimadore start with Repair d6 and their choice of one of the following at d6: Knowledge (Computers), Knowledge (Cybernetics), Knowledge (Electronics), or Knowledge (Engineering).
